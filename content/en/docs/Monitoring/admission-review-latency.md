title: Admission Review Latency
description: This metric can be used to track the end-to-end latencies associated with the entire individual admission review, corresponding to the incoming resource request triggering a bunch of policies and rules.
weight: 40

#### Metric Name(s)

* `kyverno_admission_review_duration_seconds_count`
* `kyverno_admission_review_duration_seconds_sum`
* `kyverno_admission_review_duration_seconds_bucket`

#### Metric Value

Histogram - A float value representing the latency of the admission review in seconds.

See [Prometheus docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/histograms/) for a detailed explanation of how histograms work.

#### Metric Labels

| Label | Allowed Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| request\_allowed | "true", "false" | If the admission review was accepeted or rejected. |
| request\_webhook | "ValidatingWebhookConfiguration", "MutatingWebhookConfiguration" | Type of webhook processing the admission review. |
| resource\_kind | "Pod", "Deployment", "StatefulSet", "ReplicaSet", etc. | Kind of this resource |
| resource\_namespace | | Namespace in which this resource lives |
| resource\_request\_operation | "create", "update", "delete" | If the requested resource is being created, updated, or deleted. |

#### Use cases

* The cluster admin wants to know how fast/slow have the admission reviews been for incoming requests around “Deployment” creations in the default namespace.
* The cluster admin wants to be alerted as soon as the p95 latency of admission reviews associated with the incoming “Pod” creation requests breach a certain threshold.

#### Useful Queries

* Average latency associated with the admission reviews triggered by incoming resource requests, grouped by the resource:<br> 
`avg(kyverno_admission_review_duration_seconds{}) by (resource_type)`

* Maximum latency associated with the admission reviews triggered by incoming pod requests over last 24 hours:<br>
`max(kyverno_admission_review_duration_seconds{resource_type="Pod"}[24h])`

* Listing the admission request which consumed maximum amount of latency in the last 60 minutes:<br> 
`max(kyverno_admission_review_duration_seconds{}[60m])`
