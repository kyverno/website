**Metric Name**

kyverno_admission_review_duration_seconds

**Metric Value**

Histogram - A float value representing the latency of the admission review in seconds.

## Use cases

* The cluster admin wants to know how fast/slow have the admission reviews been for incoming requests around “Deployment” creations in the default namespace.
* The cluster admin wants to be alerted as soon as the p95 latency of admission reviews associated with the incoming “Pod” creation requests breach a certain threshold.

## Useful Queries

* Average latency associated with the admission reviews triggered by incoming resource requests, grouped by the resource:<br> 
`avg(kyverno_admission_review_duration_seconds{}) by (resource_type)`

* Maximum latency associated with the admission reviews triggered by incoming pod requests over last 24 hours:<br>
`max(kyverno_admission_review_duration_seconds{resource_type="Pod"}[24h])`

* Listing the admission request which consumed maximum amount of latency in the last 60 minutes:<br> 
`max(kyverno_admission_review_duration_seconds{}[60m])`
