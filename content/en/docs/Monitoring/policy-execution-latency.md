title: Policy Rule Execution Latency
description: This metric can be used to track the latencies associated with the execution/processing of the individual rules whenever they evaluate incoming resource requests or execute background scans. This metric can be further aggregated to present latencies at the policy-level.
weight: 30

#### Metric Name(s)

* `kyverno_policy_execution_duration_seconds_count`
* `kyverno_policy_execution_duration_seconds_sum`
* `kyverno_policy_execution_duration_seconds_bucket`

#### Metric Value

Histogram - A float value representing the latency of the rule's execution in seconds.

See [Prometheus docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/histograms/) for a detailed explanation of how histograms work.

#### Metric Labels

| Label | Allowed Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| policy\_background\_mode | "true", "false" | Policy's set background mode |
| policy\_name | | Name of the policy to which the rule belongs |
| policy\_namespace | | Namespace in which this Policy resides (only for policies with kind: Policy), For ClusterPolicies, this field will be "-" |
| policy\_type | "cluster", "namespaced" | Kind of the rule's parent policy. Kind: ClusterPolicy or Kind: Policy |
| policy\_validation\_mode | "enforce", "audit" | PolicyValidationFailure action of the rule's parent policy |
| resource\_kind | "Pod", "Deployment", "StatefulSet", "ReplicaSet", etc. | Kind of this resource |
| resource\_namespace | | Namespace in which this resource lives |
| resource\_request\_operation | "create", "update", "delete" | If the requested resource is being created, updated, or deleted. |
| rule\_execution\_cause | "admission\_request", "background\_scan" | Identifies whether the rule is executing in response to an admission request or a periodic background scan.<br>In background scans, only validate rules whereas in the case of admission requests, all validate/mutate/generate rules run |
| rule\_name | | Name of the rule, in the above policy, which is evaluating in this situation |
| rule\_result | "PASS", "FAIL" | Result of the rule's execution |
| rule\_type | "validate", "mutate", "generate" | Rule's behavior type.<br>For rule\_execution\_cause="background\_scan", it will always be "validate" as background scans only run validate rules |

#### Use cases

* The cluster admin wants to know how efficiently the policies are getting executed by tracking the average latencies associated with the Kyverno policies' execution since the last 24 hrs.
* The cluster admin wants to track the rule causing highest latency in a certain cluster policy.

#### Useful Queries

* Tracking the average latency associated with the execution of rules grouped by their rule types (validate, mutate, generate):<br>
`avg(kyverno_policy_execution_duration_seconds{}) by (rule_type)`

* Listing the validate rule with maximum latency in the past 24h:<br>
`max(kyverno_policy_execution_duration_seconds{rule_type="validate"}[24h])`

* Tracking the average policy-level execution latency of the enforce policies in the namespace "default":<br>
`avg(kyverno_policy_execution_duration_seconds{policy_validation_mode="enforce", policy_namespace="default", policy_type="namespaced"}) by (policy_name)`
