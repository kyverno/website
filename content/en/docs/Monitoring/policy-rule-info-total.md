#### Metric Name(s)

* `kyverno_policy_rule_info_total`

#### Metric Value

Gauge - `1` for rules currently actively present in the cluster.

#### Metric Labels

| Label | Allowed Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| policy\_background\_mode | "true", "false" | Policy's set background mode |
| policy\_name | | Name of the policy to which the rule belongs |
| policy\_namespace | | Namespace in which this Policy resides (only for policies with kind: Policy), For ClusterPolicies, this field will be "-" |
| policy\_type | "cluster", "namespaced" | Kind of the rule's parent policy. Kind: ClusterPolicy or Kind: Policy |
| policy\_validation\_mode | "enforce", "audit" | PolicyValidationFailure action of the rule's parent policy |
| rule\_name | | Name of the rule, in the above policy, which is evaluating in this situation |
| rule\_type | "validate", "mutate", "generate" | Rule's behavior type.<br>For rule\_execution\_cause="background\_scan", it will always be "validate" as background scans only run validate rules |
| status\_ready | "true", "false" | Readiness of the policy. When ready, the policy is able to serve admission requests |

#### Use cases

* The cluster admin wants to know the average number of cluster policies in the cluster since last 1 year.
* The cluster admin wants to track the trend of the count of policies applied in the default namespace.
* The cluster admin wants to track and see the month when the default namespace possessed the highest number of policies.

#### Useful Queries

* Tracking the count of the cluster policies currently active:<br> 
`count(count(kyverno_policy_rule_info_total{policy_type="cluster"} == 1) by (policy_name))`

* Tracking the per-minute rate (avged over 30s) at which "validate" rules (both of cluster and namespaced policies) are being added to the cluster:<br> 
`rate(kyverno_policy_rule_info_total{rule_type="validate"}[30s] == 1)*60`

* Tracking the total number of mutate rules added in the last 24hrs:<br> 
`count(kyverno_policy_rule_info_total{rule_type="mutate"}[24h]==1)`

* Tracking the total number of active policies with enforce mode and background mode:<br>
`count(count(kyverno_policy_rule_info_total{policy_validation_mode="enforce", policy_background_mode="true"}==1) by (policy_name))`
