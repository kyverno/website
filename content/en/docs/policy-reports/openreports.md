title: OpenReports Integration 
description: Use openreports.io/v1alpha1 for policy reporting in Kyverno.
weight: 15

> **Note:** OpenReports integration is available as of Kyverno 1.15. The feature is in ALPHA status

Kyverno supports reporting policy results using the `openreports.io/v1alpha1` API as an alternative to the default wgpolicyk8s reporting. This can be enabled using the `--openreportsEnabled` flag in the Kyverno controller.

This is an initial step to eventually deprecate `wgpolicyk8s` and fully depend on `openreports.io` as the API group for permanent reports

### Enabling OpenReports

To enable OpenReports integration, add the `--openreportsEnabled` flag to the Kyverno reports controller.

If you are deploying Kyverno using Helm, setting the chart value `openreports.enabled=true` will automatically add the `--openreportsEnabled` flag to the reports controller deployment.

### Example: Enforcing an 'app' Label

Below is an example Kyverno policy that enforces the presence of an `app` label on all Pods. When this policy is applied and OpenReports integration is enabled, Kyverno will generate reports in the `openreports.io/v1alpha1` API group.

#### Policy Example

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: require-app-label
  namespace: default
spec:
  admission: true
  background: true
  rules:
  - match:
      resources:
        kinds:
        - Pod
    name: check-app-label
    skipBackgroundRequests: true
    validate: 
      message: Pods must have an 'app' label.
      pattern:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: ?*
  validationFailureAction: enforce
```

#### Example OpenReports Output

You can view the reports as follows:

```sh
$ kubectl get reports -A -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: openreports.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Report
  metadata:
    labels:
      app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kyverno
    name: 7d23ea02-1526-4a4f-ba14-49665adf55e
  results:
  - message: "validation error: Pods must have an 'app' label. rule check-app-label failed at path /metadata/labels/app/"
    policy: default/require-app-label
    properties:
      process: background scan
