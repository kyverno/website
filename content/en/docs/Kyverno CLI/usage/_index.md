{{% alert title="Working with kustomize" color="info" %}}
When using the Kyverno CLI with [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/), it is recommended to use the "[standalone](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/binaries/)" version as opposed to the version embedded inside `kubectl`.
