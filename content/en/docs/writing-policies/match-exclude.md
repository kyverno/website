The `match` and `exclude` filters control the scope to which rules are applied. They have the same structure and can each contain **only one** of the two elements:

* `any`: specify [resource filters](#resource-filters) on which Kyverno will perform the logical **OR** operation while choosing resources
* `all`: specify [resource filters](#resource-filters) on which Kyverno will perform the logical **AND** operation while choosing resources

## Resource Filters

The following resource filters can be specified under an `any` or `all` clause.

* `resources`: select resources by names, namespaces, kinds, operations, label selectors, annotations, and namespace selectors.
* `subjects`: select users, user groups, and service accounts
* `roles`: select namespaced roles
* `clusterRoles`: select cluster wide roles

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
Specifying resource filters directly under `match` and `exclude` has been marked for deprecation and will be removed in a future release. Matches and exclusions should always use `any` or `all` blocks.
{{% /alert %}}

At least one element must be specified in a `match.(any/all).resources.kinds` or `exclude` block. The `kind` attribute is mandatory when working with the `resources` element. Wildcards (`*`) are supported in the `resources.kinds` and `subjects` fields.

In addition, a user may specify the `group` and `apiVersion` with a kind in the `match` / `exclude` declarations for a policy rule, known as GVK format.

Supported formats:

* `Group/Version/Kind`
* `Version/Kind`
* `Kind`

To resolve kind naming conflicts, specify the API group and version. For example, the Kubernetes API, Calico, and Antrea all register a Custom Resource with the name NetworkPolicy. These can be distinguished as:

* `networking.k8s.io/v1/NetworkPolicy`
* `crd.antrea.io/v1alpha1/NetworkPolicy`

Wildcards are supported with the following formats when used in the `resources.kinds` field:

* `Group/*/Kind`
* `Group/*/*`
* `*/Kind`
* `*`

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
* A policy using wildcards in `match` or `exclude` or that validates subresources is not allowed in background mode.
* A policy using wildcards does not support `generate` or `verifyImages` rule types, and does not support `forEach` declarations.
* For the `validate` rule type, a policy can only deal with `deny` statements and the `metadata` object in either  `pattern` or `anyPattern` blocks.
* For the `mutate` rule type, a policy can only deal with the `metadata` object.
{{% /alert %}}

Subresources may be specified with either a `/` or `.` as a separator between parent and subresource. For example, `Pods/status` or `Pods.status` will match on the `/status` subresource for a Pod. They may be combined with previous naming as well, for example `apps/v1/Deployment/scale` or `v1/Pod.eviction`. Wildcards are also supported when referencing subresources, for example `*/Node/status`. Some subresources are shared by multiple API resources, for example the `Scale` resource. Due to this, matching on `Scale` may apply to resources like `Deployment` as well as `ReplicationController` since `Scale` is common between both. Use of a parent resource followed by its subresource is necessary to be explicit in the matching decision. Specifying a subresource in the format `PodExecOptions` is not supported.

When Kyverno receives an AdmissionReview request (i.e., from a validation or mutation webhook), it first checks to see if the resource and user information matches or should be excluded from processing. If both checks pass, then the rule logic to mutate, validate, or generate resources is applied.

## Match statements

In every rule, there must be a single `match` statement to function as the filter to which the rule will apply. Although the `match` statement can be complex having many different elements, there must be at least one. The most common type of element in a `match` statement is one which filters on categories of Kubernetes resources, for example Pods, Deployments, Services, Namespaces, etc. Variable substitution is not currently supported in `match` or `exclude` statements. `match` statements also require an `any` or `all` expression allowing greater flexibility in treating multiple conditions.

In this snippet, the `match` statement matches on all resources that **EITHER** have the kind Service with name "staging" **OR** have the kind Service and are being created in the "prod" Namespace.

```yaml
match:
  any:
  - resources:
      kinds: 
      - Service
      names: 
      - staging
      operations:
      - CREATE
  - resources:
      kinds: 
      - Service
      namespaces:
      - prod
      operations:
      - CREATE
```

The `operations[]` list is optional but recommended. When `operations[]` is absent, the default behavior is to match on `CREATE` and `UPDATE` requests.

By combining multiple elements in the `match` statement, you can be more selective as to which resources you wish to process. Additionally, wildcards are supported for even greater control. For example, by adding the `resources.names` field, the previous `match` statement can further filter out Services that begin with the text "prod-" **OR** have the name "staging". `resources.names` takes in a list of names and would match all resources which have either of those names.

```yaml
match:
  any:
  - resources:
      names: 
      - "prod-*"
      - "staging"
      kinds:
      - Service
      operations:
      - CREATE
  - resources:
      kinds:
      - Service
      operations:
      - CREATE
    subjects:
    - kind: User
      name: dave
```

`match.any[0]` will now match on only Services that begin with the name "prod-" **OR** have the name "staging" and not those which begin with "dev-" or any other prefix. `match.any[1]` will match all Services being created by the `dave` user regardless of the name of the Service. And since these two are specified under the `any` key, the entire rule will act on all Services with names `prod-*` or `staging` **OR** on all services being created by the `dave` user. In both `match` and `exclude` statements, [wildcards](validate.md#wildcards) are supported to make selection more flexible.

In this snippet, the `match` statement matches only resources that have the group `networking.k8s.io`, version `v1` and kind `NetworkPolicy`. By adding Group,Version,Kind in the match statement, you can be more selective as to which resources you wish to process.

```yaml
match:
  any:
  - resources:
      kinds:
      - networking.k8s.io/v1/NetworkPolicy
```

By specifying the `kind` in `version/kind` format, only specific versions of the resource kind will be matched.

```yaml
match:
  any:
  - resources:
      kinds:
      - v1/NetworkPolicy
```

Wildcards are supported in the `kinds` field allowing you to match on every resource type in the cluster. Selector labels support wildcards `(* or ?)` for keys as well as values in the following paths.

* `match.any.resources.selector.matchLabels`
* `match.all.resources.selector.matchLabels`
* `exclude.any.resources.selector.matchLabels`
* `exclude.all.resources.selector.matchLabels`

Supported formats:

* `*`
* `*pattern*`
* `*pattern`
* `pattern?`
* `patte?rn`

In the below policy, all resource kinds are checked for the existence of a label having key `app.kubernetes.io/name`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: require-labels
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Audit
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: check-for-labels
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - "*"
          operations:
          - CREATE
    validate:
      message: "The label `app.kubernetes.io/name` is required."
      pattern:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: "?*"
```

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
Keep in mind that when matching on all kinds (`*`) the policy you write must be applicable across all of them. Typical uses for this type of wildcard matching are elements within the `metadata` object. This type of matching should be used sparingly and carefully as it will instruct the API server to send every eligible resource type to Kyverno, greatly increasing the amount of processing performed by Kyverno.
{{% /alert %}}

Matches for Namespaced resources can also be selected using Namespace labels by using the `namespaceSelector` field. This field allows selection in two granular ways: by using `matchLabels` or `matchExpressions`. When using `matchLabels`, a map of Namespace labels can be used to specify the match. For more advanced selection logic, use the `matchExpressions` element.

In the below example, Kyverno will only consider matching Pods as those in a Namespace which contains the label `organization: engineering`.

```yaml
match:
  any:
  - resources:
      kinds:
      - Pod
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          organization: engineering
```

And in this example, Kyverno will select Pods in a Namespace where the label key `namespacekind` does not equal the value `platform` or `ci`.

```yaml
match:
  any:
  - resources:
      kinds:
      - Pod
      namespaceSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: namespacekind
          operator: NotIn
          values:
          - platform
          - ci
```

Here are some other examples of `match` statements.

### Match a Deployment or StatefulSet with a specific label

This is an example that selects a Deployment **OR** a StatefulSet with a label `app=critical`.

Condition checks inside the `resources` block follow the logic "**AND across types but an OR within list types**". For example, if a rule match contains a list of kinds and a list of namespaces, the rule will be evaluated if the request contains any one (OR) of the kinds AND any one (OR) of the namespaces. Conditions inside `clusterRoles`, `roles`, and `subjects` are always evaluated using a logical OR operation, as each request can only have a single instance of these values.

In the below snippet, `kinds` and `selector` are peer/sibling elements, and so they are **AND**ed together.

```yaml
match:
  any:
  # AND across kinds and namespaceSelector
  - resources:
      # OR inside list of kinds
      kinds:
      - Deployment
      - StatefulSet
      operations:
      - CREATE
      - UPDATE
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: critical
```

This pattern can be leveraged to produce very fine-grained control over the selection of resources, for example the snippet as shown below which combines `match` elements that include `resources`, `subjects`, `roles`, and `clusterRoles`.

### Advanced match statement

```yaml
spec:
  # validationFailureAction controls admission control behaviors,
  # when a policy rule fails:
  # - use 'Enforce' to block resource creation or modification
  # - use 'Audit' to allow resource updates and report policy violations
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  # Each policy has a list of rules applied in declaration order
  rules:
    # Rules must have a unique name
    - name: check-pod-controller-labels
      # Each rule matches specific resource described by "match" field.
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds: # Required, list of kinds
            - Deployment
            - StatefulSet
            # Optional resource names. Supports wildcards (* and ?)
            names: 
            - "mongo*"
            - "postgres*"
            # Optional list of namespaces. Supports wildcards (* and ?)
            operations:
            - CREATE
            - UPDATE
            namespaces:
            - "dev*"
            - test
            # Optional label selectors. Values support wildcards (* and ?)
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                app: mongodb
              matchExpressions:
                - {key: tier, operator: In, values: [database]}
          # Optional users or service accounts to be matched
          subjects:
          - kind: User
            name: mary@somecorp.com
          # Optional clusterroles to be matched
          clusterRoles: 
          - cluster-admin
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
Although the above snippet is useful for showing the types of matching that you can use, most policies either use one or just a couple different elements within their `match` statements.
{{% /alert %}}

### Match Deployments in Namespaces using labels

This example selects Deployments in Namespaces that have a label `type=connector` or `type=compute` using a `namespaceSelector`.

Here, `kinds` and `namespaceSelector` are peer elements under `match.resources` and are evaluated using a logical **AND** operation.

```yaml
spec:
  rules:
    - name: check-min-replicas
      match:
        any:
        # AND across resources and selector
        - resources:
            # OR inside list of kinds
            kinds:
            - Deployment
            operations:
            - CREATE
            - UPDATE
            namespaceSelector:
              matchExpressions:
                - key: type 
                  operator: In
                  values: 
                  - connector
                  - compute
```

## Combining match and exclude

In cases where a subset of the resources selected in a `match` block need to be omitted from processing, you may optionally use an `exclude` block. For example, you wish to only process Pods which do not have the label `env=prod`. An `exclude` block can be used to select those with the label `env=prod`. An `exclude` block must therefore be a subset of the `match` block.

All `match` and `exclude` conditions must be satisfied for a resource to be selected for the policy rule. In other words, the `match` and `exclude` conditions are evaluated using a logical **AND** operation. Elements in the `exclude` block follow the same specifications as those in the `match` block.

### Exclude `cluster-admin` ClusterRole

Here is an example of a rule that matches all Pods excluding those created by using the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole.

```yaml
spec:
  rules:
    - name: match-pods-except-cluster-admin
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - Pod
            operations:
            - CREATE
            - UPDATE
      exclude:
        any:
        - clusterRoles:
          - cluster-admin
```

### Exclude `prod-alpha` Namespace

This rule matches all Pods except those in the `prod-alpha` Namespace.

```yaml
spec:
  rules:
    - name: match-pods-except-admin
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - Pod
            operations:
            - CREATE
            - UPDATE
      exclude:
        any:
        - resources:
            namespaces:
            - prod-alpha
```

### Match a label and exclude users and roles

The following example matches all resources with label `app=critical` excluding the resources created by ClusterRole `cluster-admin` **OR** by the user `John`.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
Since `roles` and `clusterRoles` are built internally by Kyverno from AdmissionReview contents, rules which contain either of these must define `background: false` since the AdmissionReview payload is not available in background mode. `subjects` are also not allowed in background mode as this information is not available once a resource has been created.
{{% /alert %}}

```yaml
spec:
  rules:
    - name: match-criticals-except-given-rbac
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kind:
            - Pod
            operations:
            - CREATE
            - UPDATE
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                app: critical
      exclude:
        any:
        - clusterRoles:
          - cluster-admin
        - subjects:
          - kind: User
            name: John
```

### Match a label and exclude users

A variation on the above sample, this snippet uses `any` and `all` statements to exclude multiple users.

```yaml
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: match-criticals-except-given-users
      match:
        all:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - Pod
            operations:
            - CREATE
            - UPDATE
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                app: critical
      exclude:
        any:
        - subjects:
          - kind: User
            name: susan
          - kind: User
            name: dave
```

### Match all Pods using annotations

Here is an example of a rule that matches all Pods having `imageregistry: "https://hub.docker.com/"` annotations.

```yaml
spec:
  rules:
    - name: match-pod-annotations
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            annotations:
              imageregistry: "https://hub.docker.com/"
            kinds:
              - Pod
            operations:
            - CREATE
            - UPDATE
```

## Configure webhooks

Webhook configurations can be configured using policies. Webhook operations per resource is dynamically set if there are match/exclude operations mentioned in the policies applied. If for a resource no operations are set in match or exclude blocks, default operations are applied in the webhooks rules. Default operations for validating resources are CONNECT, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE and for mutating resources are CREATE, UPDATE.

For a policy like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: require-labels
  annotations:
    pod-policies.kyverno.io/autogen-controllers: none
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Audit
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: require-team
      match:
        any:
          - resources:
              kinds:
              - Namespace
              operations:
              - CREATE
      validate:
        message: 'The label `team` is required.'
        pattern:
          metadata:
            labels:
              team: '?*'
    - name: require-match
      match:
        any:
          - resources:
              kinds:
              - Deployment
              operations:
              - UPDATE
      validate:
        message: 'The label `match` is required.'
        pattern:
          metadata:
            labels:
              match: '?*'
```

The webhook rules would look like this:

```yaml
  rules:
  - apiGroups:
    - ""
    apiVersions:
    - v1
    operations:
    - CREATE
    resources:
    - namespaces
    scope: '*'
  - apiGroups:
    - apps
    apiVersions:
    - v1
    operations:
    - UPDATE
    resources:
    - deployments
    scope: '*'
```
