[Sigstore](https://sigstore.dev/) is a [Linux Foundation project](https://linuxfoundation.org/) focused on software signing and transparency log technologies to improve software supply chain security. [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) is a sub-project that provides image signing, verification, and storage in an OCI registry.

## Verifying Image Signatures

Container images can be signed during the build phase of a CI/CD pipeline using the Cosign CLI. An image can be signed with multiple signatures, for example at the organization level and at the project level.

The policy rule check fails if the required signatures are not found in the OCI registry, or if the image was not signed using matching attestors.

The rule mutates matching images to add the [image digest](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/#pull-an-image-by-digest-immutable-identifier), when `mutateDigest` is set to `true` (which is the default), if the digest is not already specified. Using an image digest has the benefit of making image references immutable. This helps ensure that the version of the deployed image does not change and, for example, is the same version that was scanned and verified by a vulnerability scanning and detection tool.

Here is a sample image verification policy which ensures an image from the `ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image` repository, using any tag, is signed with the corresponding public key as defined in the policy:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: check-image
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  webhookTimeoutSeconds: 30
  failurePolicy: Fail
  rules:
    - name: check-image
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Pod
      verifyImages:
      - imageReferences:
        - "ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image*"
        attestors:
        - count: 1
          entries:
          - keys:
              publicKeys: |-
                -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE8nXRh950IZbRj8Ra/N9sbqOPZrfM
                5/KAQN0/KjHcorm/J5yctVd7iEcnessRQjU917hmKO6JWVGHpDguIyakZA==
                -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
              rekor:
                ignoreTlog: true
                url: https://rekor.sigstore.dev
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
The public key may either be defined in the policy directly or reference a standard Kubernetes Secret elsewhere in the cluster by specifying it in the format `k8s://<namespace>/<secret_name>`. The named Secret must specify a key `cosign.pub` containing the public key used for verification. Secrets may also be referenced using the `secret{}` object. See `kubectl explain clusterpolicy.spec.rules.verifyImages.attestors.entries.keys` for more details on the supported key options.
{{% /alert %}}

A signed image can be run as follows:

```sh
kubectl run signed --image=ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image:signed
pod/signed created
```

The deployed Pod will be mutated to use the image digest.

Attempting to run an unsigned image will produce a policy error as follows:

```sh
kubectl run unsigned --image=ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image:unsigned
Error from server: admission webhook "mutate.kyverno.svc" denied the request:

resource Pod/default/unsigned was blocked due to the following policies

check-image:
  check-image: 'image verification failed for ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image:unsigned:
    signature not found'
```

Similarly, attempting to run an image which matches the specified rule but is signed with a different key will produce an error:

```sh
kubectl run signed-other --image=ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image:signed-by-someone-else
Error from server: admission webhook "mutate.kyverno.svc" denied the request:

resource Pod/default/signed-other was blocked due to the following policies

check-image:
  check-image: 'image verification failed for ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image:signed-by-someone-else:
    invalid signature'
```

### Skipping Image References

`skipImageReferences` can be used to precisely filter image references that should be verified by a policy. A list of references can be specified in `skipImageReferences` and images that match those references will be excluded from image verification process. The following example will match all images from `ghcr.io` but will skip images from `ghcr.io/trusted`. 

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: exclude-refs
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  webhookTimeoutSeconds: 30
  failurePolicy: Fail  
  rules:
    - name: exclude-refs
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Pod
      verifyImages:
      - imageReferences:
        - "ghcr.io/*"
        skipImageReferences:
        - "ghcr.io/trusted/*"
        attestors:
        - count: 1
          entries:
          - keys:
              publicKeys: |-
                -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE8nXRh950IZbRj8Ra/N9sbqOPZrfM
                5/KAQN0/KjHcorm/J5yctVd7iEcnessRQjU917hmKO6JWVGHpDguIyakZA==
                -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

### Signing images

To sign images, install [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#installation) and generate a public-private key pair.

```sh
cosign generate-key-pair
```

Next, use the `cosign sign` command and specifying the private key in the `--key` command line argument.

```sh
# ${IMAGE} is REPOSITORY/PATH/NAME:TAG
cosign sign --key cosign.key ${IMAGE}
```

This command will sign your image and publish the signature to the OCI registry. You can verify the signature using the `cosign verify` command.

```sh
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ${IMAGE}
```

Refer to the [Cosign documentation](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#quick-start) for usage details and [OCI registry support](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#registry-support).

## Verifying Image Attestations

Container image signatures prove that the image was signed by the holder of a matching private key. However, signatures do not provide additional data and intent that frameworks like [SLSA (Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts)](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-slsa-end-to-end-framework.html) require.

An attestation is metadata attached to software artifacts like images. Signed attestations provide verifiable information required for [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/).

The [in-toto attestation format](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation) provides a flexible scheme for metadata such as repository and build environment details, vulnerability scan reports, test results, code review reports, or any other information that is used to verify image integrity. Each attestation contains a signed statement with a `predicateType` and a `predicate`. Here is an example derived from the in-toto site:

```json
{
  "payloadType": "https://example.com/CodeReview/v1",
  "payload": {
    "_type": "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v0.1",
    "predicateType": "https://example.com/CodeReview/v1",
    "subject": [
      {
        "name": "registry.io/org/app",
        "digest": {
          "sha256": "b31bfb4d0213f254d361e0079deaaebefa4f82ba7aa76ef82e90b4935ad5b105"
        }
      }
    ],
    "predicate": {
      "author": "alice@example.com",
      "repo": {
        "branch": "main",
        "type": "git",
        "uri": "https://git-repo.com/org/app"
      },
      "reviewers": [
        "bob@example.com"
      ]
    }
  },
  "signatures": [
    {
      "keyid": "",
      "sig": "MEYCIQDtJYN8dq9RACVUYljdn6t/BBONrSaR8NDpB+56YdcQqAIhAKRgiQIFvGyQERJJYjq2+6Jq2tkVbFpQMXPU0Zu8Gu1S"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `imageVerify` rule can contain one or more attestation checks that verify the contents of the `predicate`. Here is an example that verifies the repository URI, the branch, and the reviewers.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: attest-code-review
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  webhookTimeoutSeconds: 30
  failurePolicy: Fail
  rules:
    - name: attest
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Pod
      verifyImages:
      - imageReferences:
        - "registry.io/org/app*"
        attestations:
          - predicateType: https://example.com/CodeReview/v1
            attestors:
            - entries:
              - keys:
                  publicKeys: |-
                    -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                    MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEzDB0FiCzAWf/BhHLpikFs6p853/G
                    3A/jt+GFbOJjpnr7vJyb28x4XnR1M5pwUUcpzIZkIgSsd+XcTnrBPVoiyw==
                    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
            conditions:
              - all:
                - key: "{{ repo.uri }}"
                  operator: Equals
                  value: "https://git-repo.com/org/app"            
                - key: "{{ repo.branch }}"
                  operator: Equals
                  value: "main"
                - key: "{{ reviewers }}"
                  operator: AnyIn
                  value: ["ana@example.com", "bob@example.com"]
```

The policy rule above fetches and verifies that the attestations are signed with the matching private key, decodes the payloads to extract the predicate, and then applies each [condition](../../preconditions.md#any-and-all-statements) to the predicate.

Each `verifyImages` rule can be used to verify signatures or attestations, but not both. This allows the flexibility of using separate signatures for attestations. The `attestors{}` object appears both under `verifyImages` as well as `verifyImages.attestations`. Use of it in the former location is for image signature validation while use in the latter is for attestations only.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
The structure of the predicate may differ slightly depending on the predicate type used during attestation. Use `cosign verify-attestation` by passing the expected predicate type with the `--type` flag and examine the predicate structure to ensure the expression you're writing is accurate.
{{% /alert %}}

### Signing attestations

To sign attestations, use the `cosign attest` command. This command will sign your attestations and publish them to the OCI registry.

```sh
# ${IMAGE} is REPOSITORY/PATH/NAME:TAG
cosign attest --key cosign.key --predicate <file> --type <predicate type>  ${IMAGE}
```

You can use a custom attestation type with a JSON document as the predicate. For example, with the code review example above the predicate body can be specified in a file `predicate.json` with the contents:

```json
{
    "author": "alice@example.com",
    "repo": {
        "branch": "main",
        "type": "git",
        "uri": "https://git-repo.com/org/app"
    },
    "reviewers": [
        "bob@example.com"
    ]
}
```

The following cosign command creates the in-toto format attestation and signs it with the specified credentials using the custom predicate type `https://example.com/CodeReview/v1`:

```sh
cosign attest ghcr.io/jimbugwadia/app1:v1 --key <KEY> --predicate predicate.json  --type https://example.com/CodeReview/v1
```

This flexible scheme allows attesting and verifying any JSON document, including vulnerability scan reports and Software Bill Of Materials (SBOMs).

Attestations, such as the snippet shown above, are base64 encoded by default and may be verified and viewed with the `cosign verify-attestation` command. For example, the below command will verify and decode the attestation of type `slsaprovenance` for a given image which was signed with the [keyless signing ability](#keyless-signing-and-verification).

```sh
COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=true cosign verify-attestation --type slsaprovenance registry.io/myrepo/myimage:mytag | jq .payload -r | base64 --decode | jq
```

Verification of an attestation using a public key can be done simply:

```sh
cosign verify-attestation --key cosign.pub --type <type> ${IMAGE}
```

Refer to the [Cosign documentation](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#quick-start) for additional details including [OCI registry support](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#registry-support).

## Certificate based signing and verification

This policy checks if an image is signed using a certificate. The root certificate, and any intermediary certificates in the signing chain, can also be provided in the `certChain` declaration.

                -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

This enables use cases where, in an enterprise with a private CA, each team has their own leaf certificate used for signing their images, and a global policy is used to verify all images signatures.

### Signing images using certificates

To use certificates for image signing, you must first extract the public key using the `cosign import` command.

Assuming you have a root CA `myCA.pem` and a public-private certificate pair `test.crt` and `test.key`, you can convert the public certificate to a key as follows:

```sh
cosign import-key-pair --key test.key
```

This creates the `import-cosign.key` and `import-cosign.pub` files. You can then sign using the certificate as follows:

```sh
cosign sign $IMAGE --key import-cosign.key --cert test.crt --cert-chain myCA.pem 
```

This image can now be verified using the leaf or root certificates.

## Keyless signing and verification

The following policy verifies an image signed using ephemeral keys and signing data stored in a transparency log, known as [keyless signing](https://docs.sigstore.dev/signing/overview/):

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: check-image-keyless
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  webhookTimeoutSeconds: 30
  rules:
    - name: check-image-keyless
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Pod
      verifyImages:
      - imageReferences:
        - "ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image:signed-keyless"
        attestors:
        - entries:
          - keyless:
              subject: "*@nirmata.com"
              issuer: "https://accounts.google.com"
              rekor:
                url: https://rekor.sigstore.dev
```

### Keyless signing

To sign images using the keyless flow, use the following cosign command:

```sh
COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign sign ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image:signed-keyless
```

This command generates ephemeral keys and launches a webpage to confirm an OIDC identity using providers like GitHub, Microsoft, or Google. The subject and issuer used in the policy must match the identity information provided during signing.

### Keyless signing with GitHub Workflows

GitHub supports [OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#understanding-the-oidc-token) for workflow identities that eliminates the need for managing hard-coded secrets. A GitHub OIDC token can be used for keyless signing. In this case, the `subject` in the ephemeral certificate provides the identity of the workflow that executes the image signing tasks.

Since GitHub workflows can be reused in other workflows, it is important to verify the identity of both the executing workflow and the actual workflow used for signing. This can be done using attributes stored in X.509 certificate extensions.

The policy rule fragment checks for the `subject` and `issuer` from the certificate. The rule also checks for additional extensions registered using [Fulcio Object IDs](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/blob/main/docs/oid-info.md).

```yaml
attestors:
- entries:
  - keyless:
      subject: "https://github.com/{{ORGANIZATION}}/{{REPOSITORY}}/.github/workflows/{{WORKFLOW}}@refs/tags/*"
      issuer: "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
      additionalExtensions:
        githubWorkflowTrigger: push
        githubWorkflowSha: {{WORKFLOW_COMMIT_SHA}}
        githubWorkflowName: {{WORKFLOW_NAME}}
        githubWorkflowRepository: {{WORKFLOW_ORGANIZATION}}/{{WORKFLOW_REPOSITORY}}
      rekor:
        url: https://rekor.sigstore.dev
```

## Using a Key Management Service (KMS)

Kyverno and Cosign support using Key Management Services (KMS) such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and HashiCorp Vault. This integration allows referencing public and private keys using a URI syntax, instead of embedding the key directly in the policy.

The supported formats include:

* azurekms://[VAULT_NAME][VAULT_URI]/[KEY]
* awskms://[ENDPOINT]/[ID/ALIAS/ARN]
* gcpkms://projects/[PROJECT]/locations/global/keyRings/[KEYRING]/cryptoKeys/[KEY]
* hashivault://[KEY]

Refer to https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/kms_support for additional details.

### Enabling IRSA to access AWS KMS

When running Kyverno in a AWS EKS cluster, you can use IAM Roles for Service Accounts ([IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)) to grant the Kyverno ServiceAccount permission to retrieve the public key(s) it needs from AWS KMS.

Once IRSA is enabled, the Kyverno ServiceAccount will have a new annotation with the IAM role it can assume, and the Kyverno Pod will assume this IAM role through the cluster's OIDC provider. To understand how IRSA works internally, see links below:

* [IAM roles for service accounts (EKS Documentation)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)
* [IAM Roles for Service Accounts (eksworkshop.com)](https://www.eksworkshop.com/beginner/110_irsa/)
* [Understanding IAM roles for service accounts, IRSA, on AWS EKS (Medium)](https://medium.com/@ankit.wal/the-how-of-iam-roles-for-service-accounts-irsa-on-aws-eks-3d76badb8942)
* [Verifying images in a private Amazon ECR with Kyverno and IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](/blog/2023/08/18/verifying-images-in-a-private-amazon-ecr-with-kyverno-and-iam-roles-for-service-accounts-irsa/)

Sample steps to enable IRSA for Kyverno using `eksctl` (see links above if you prefer to use `AWS CLI` instead):

1. Associate IAM OIDC provider

    ```sh
    eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster <cluster-name> --approve
    ```  

2. Create IAM policy

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "kms:GetPublicKey",
                    "kms:DescribeKey"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<account-id>:key/<key-id>"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

3. Create IAM role and annotate the Kyverno ServiceAccount with it

    ```sh
    eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
        --name kyverno \
        --namespace kyverno \
        --cluster <cluster-name> \
        --attach-policy-arn "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:policy/<iam-policy>" \
        --approve \
        --override-existing-serviceaccounts
    ```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
Kyverno needs to know the AWS region for the KMS store in use. To provide this information, the environment variables `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` and `AWS_REGION` need to be set in the Kyverno Deployment.
{{% /alert %}}

## Verifying Image Annotations

Cosign has the ability to add annotations when signing an image, and Kyverno can be used to verify them. For example, this policy checks for the annotation of `sig: original`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: check-image
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  webhookTimeoutSeconds: 30
  failurePolicy: Fail
  rules:
    - name: check-image
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Pod
      verifyImages:
      - imageReferences: 
        - ghcr.io/myorg/myimage*
        attestors:
        - entries:
          - keys: 
              publicKeys: |-
                -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEvy6wqHIx5JTxdDcbFIkb6boaxBBw
                FZmwwzag3ZrsfOLT+r5DOx2LSyoef+eTda/QOcooUEZo7r4HpNbFH/y7Eg==
                -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
            annotations:
              sig: original
```

## Using private registries

Private registries are defined as those requiring authentication in order to pull images. A private registry may also present leaf certificates issued by internal certificate authorities. To use a private registry, depending on which of these needs apply to you, check the following sections for instructions on how to configure Kyverno appropriately.

### Authentication

In order for Kyverno to authenticate against a registry (private or otherwise), you must first create an [imagePullSecret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#using-a-private-registry) in the Kyverno Namespace and specify the Secret name as an argument to the Kyverno Deployment. Note that this is not a requirement in all cases, for example see [AWS with IRSA](#enabling-irsa-to-access-aws-kms).

1. Configure the imagePullSecret:

```sh
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
--docker-server=<server_address> \
--docker-username=<username> \
--docker-password=<password> \
--docker-email=<email> \
-n kyverno
```

2. Update the Kyverno Deployment to add the `--imagePullSecrets=regcred` argument:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: kyverno
   ...
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kyverno
      app.kubernetes.io/name: kyverno
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        ...
        - --webhooktimeout=15
        - --imagePullSecrets=regcred
```

### Trust

Kyverno does not by default have the same chain of trust as the underlying Kubernetes Nodes nor is it able to access them due to security concerns. Because the Nodes in your cluster can pull an image from a private registry (even if no authentication is required) does not mean Kyverno can. Kyverno ships with trust for the most common third-party certificate authorities and has no knowledge of internal PKI which may be in use by your private registry. Without the chain of trust established, Kyverno will not be able to fetch image metadata, signatures, or other OCI artifacts from a registry. Perform the following steps to present the necessary root certificates to Kyverno to establish trust.

There are two possible methods to present Kyverno with custom certificates. The first is to replace the internal default certificate store with your custom one in which all necessary certificates are stored in a ConfigMap. The second is to allow Kyverno to mount a hostPath volume on the underlying Node so it can read the same certificate store as the host.

#### Replace

Using this first method, you replace Kyverno's internal certificate store with your own. The certificate(s) you supply using this method will overwrite the entire certificate store Kyverno ships with by default which may prevent you from accessing public registries signed by third-party certificate authorities. This method may be favorable when you are only using private, internal registries with no need to contact external services.

To use this method, set the Helm value `global.caCertificates.data` along with the certificate(s) you wish Kyverno to trust. An example snippet is shown below.

```yaml
global:
  caCertificates:
    data: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      MIIBdjCCAR2gAwIBAgIBADAKBggqhkjOPQQDAjAjMSEwHwYDVQQDDBhrM3Mtc2Vy
      dmVyLWNhQDE2ODEzODUyNDgwHhcNMjMwNDEzMTEyNzI4WhcNMzMwNDEwMTEyNzI4
      <snip>
      mPCB0cIwCgYIKoZIzj0EAwIDRwAwRAIgYF0Dy5QuQpYFyHcQEVq5GJgrE9W4gAy2
      W/LgVuvZmucCIBcETS4DIw2pWAfeKRDaEOi2YsJoDpWd7lFLQBUbe4G7
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

When this method is used, a ConfigMap containing your certificates is written for each controller and mounted to each controller's Deployment such that it replaces the internal certificate store. These contents now serve as Kyverno's trust store.

#### Host Mount

The second method involves providing Kyverno with the same trust as your Nodes by mounting the certificate store on the Nodes on which the Kyverno Pods run. Often times this trust includes public certificate authorities but in other cases may not. This method may be favorable when you are using a combination of internal, private registries and third-party, public registries. This assumes your Nodes already include trust for both.

To use this method, set the Helm value `global.caCertificates.volume` along with a hostPath volume pointing to the certificate bundle on the Nodes where Kyverno Pods will run. An example snippet is shown below.

```yaml
global:
  caCertificates:
    volume:
      hostPath:
        path: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
        type: File
```

## Using a signature repository

To use a separate registry to store signatures use the [COSIGN_REPOSITORY](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#specifying-registry) environment variable when signing the image. Then in the Kyverno policy rule, specify the repository for each image:

```yaml
...
verifyImages:
- imageReferences:
  - ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image*
  repository: "registry.io/signatures"
  attestors:
  - entries:
    - keys:
        publicKeys: |-
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE8nXRh950IZbRj8Ra/N9sbqOPZrfM
          5/KAQN0/KjHcorm/J5yctVd7iEcnessRQjU917hmKO6JWVGHpDguIyakZA==
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
...
```

## Ignoring Tlogs and SCT Verification

Cosign uses Rekor, a transparency log service to store signatures. In Cosign 2.0 verifies Rekor entries for both key-based and identity-based signing. To disable this set `ignoreTlog: true` in Kyverno policies:

```yaml
verifyImages:
- imageReferences:
  - '*'
  attestors:
  - entries:
    - keys:
        publicKeys: |-
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE8nXRh950IZbRj8Ra/N9sbqOPZrfM
          5/KAQN0/KjHcorm/J5yctVd7iEcnessRQjU917hmKO6JWVGHpDguIyakZA==
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
        rekor:
          ignoreTlog: true
          url: https://rekor.sigstore.dev
```

Cosign also does SCT verification, a proof of inclusion in a certificate transparency log for verifying Fulcio certificates. In Cosign 2.0 it is done by default . To disable this, use `ignoreSCT: true`:

```yaml
verifyImages:
- imageReferences:
  - '*'
  attestors:
  - entries:
    - keys:
        publicKeys: |-
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE8nXRh950IZbRj8Ra/N9sbqOPZrfM
          5/KAQN0/KjHcorm/J5yctVd7iEcnessRQjU917hmKO6JWVGHpDguIyakZA==
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
        rekor:
          ignoreTlog: true
          url: https://rekor.sigstore.dev
          pubKey: |-
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE8nXRh950IZbRj8Ra/N9sbqOPZrfM
          5/KAQN0/KjHcorm/J5yctVd7iEcnessRQjU917hmKO6JWVGHpDguIyakZA==
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
        ctlog:
          ignoreSCT: true
          pubKey: |-
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE8nXRh950IZbRj8Ra/N9sbqOPZrfM
          5/KAQN0/KjHcorm/J5yctVd7iEcnessRQjU917hmKO6JWVGHpDguIyakZA==
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

## Using custom Rekor public key and CTLogs public key

You can also provide the Rekor public key and ctlog public key instead of Rekor url to verify tlog entry and SCT entry. Use `rekor.pubKey` and `ctlog.pubKey` respectively for this.

```yaml
verifyImages:
- imageReferences:
  - '*'
  attestors:
  - entries:
    - keys:
        publicKeys: |-
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE8nXRh950IZbRj8Ra/N9sbqOPZrfM
          5/KAQN0/KjHcorm/J5yctVd7iEcnessRQjU917hmKO6JWVGHpDguIyakZA==
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
        rekor:
          pubKey: |-
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEyQfmL5YwHbn9xrrgG3vgbU0KJxMY
          BibYLJ5L4VSMvGxeMLnBGdM48w5IE//6idUPj3rscigFdHs7GDMH4LLAng==
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
        ctlog:
          pubKey: |-
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEE8uGVnyDWPPlB7M5KOHRzxzPHtAy
          FdGxexVrR4YqO1pRViKxmD9oMu4I7K/4sM51nbH65ycB2uRiDfIdRoV/+A==
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

## Using a custom TUF for custom Sigstore deployments

If you want to have your own Sigstore infrastructure to be fully in control of the entire signing and verification stack, including the root key material, you can set up your own root of trust to use TUF. To configure Kyverno to use your TUF setup, use `--tufRoot` and `--tufMirror` flags for custom Sigstore deployments.

## Verifying images in Custom Resources

In addition to Kubernetes Pods, custom resources such as Tekton Tasks, Argo Workflow Steps, and others may also reference container images. In other cases, rather than an image, an OCI artifact like a Tekton Pipeline bundle may be signed. Kyverno supports verification for images and OCI Artifacts in custom resources by allowing the declaration of an `imageExtractor`, which specifies the location of the image or artifact in the custom resource.

Here is an example of a policy that verifies that Tekton task steps are signed using a private key that matches the specified public key:

```yaml

apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: signed-task-image
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
  - name: check-signature
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - tekton.dev/v1beta1/TaskRun.status
    imageExtractors:
      TaskRun:
        - name: "taskrunstatus"
          path: "/status/taskSpec/steps/*"
          value: "image"
          key: "name"
    verifyImages:
    - imageReferences:
      - "*"
      required: false
      attestors:
      - entries:
        - keys: 
            publicKeys: |-
              -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
              MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEahmSvGFmxMJABilV1usgsw6ImcQ/
              gDaxw57Sq+uNGHW8Q3zUSx46PuRqdTI+4qE3Ng2oFZgLMpFN/qMrP0MQQg==
              -----END PUBLIC KEY-----   
```

This policy rule checks that Tekton pipeline bundles are signed with a private key that matches the specified public key:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: signed-pipeline-bundle
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
  - name: check-signature
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - PipelineRun
    imageExtractors:
      PipelineRun:
        - name: "pipelineruns"
          path: /spec/pipelineRef
          value: "bundle"
          key: "name"
    verifyImages:
    - imageReferences:
      - "*"
      attestors:
      - entries:
        - keys: 
            publicKeys: |-
              -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
              MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEahmSvGFmxMJABilV1usgsw6ImcQ/
              gDaxw57Sq+uNGHW8Q3zUSx46PuRqdTI+4qE3Ng2oFZgLMpFN/qMrP0MQQg==
              -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

For Custom Resources which reference container images in a non-standard way, an optional `jmesPath` field may be used to apply a filter to transform the value of the extracted field. For example, in the case of KubeVirt's `DataVolume` custom resource, the fielding referencing the image needing verification is located at `spec.source.registry.url` as seen below.

```yaml
apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: DataVolume
metadata:
  name: registry-image-datavolume
spec:
  source:
    registry:
      url: "docker://kubevirt/fedora-cloud-registry-disk-demo"
  pvc:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 5Gi
```

The value of the field contains a prefix of `docker://` which must be removed first. Applying a JMESPath expression in an extractor along with a Kyverno custom filter such as [`trim_prefix()`](../../jmespath.md#trim_prefix) can be used to provide the container image for Kyverno to verify.

```yaml
imageExtractors:
  DataVolume:
    - path: /spec/source/registry/url
      jmesPath: "trim_prefix(@, 'docker://')"
```

## Special Variables

A pre-defined, reserved special variable named `image` is available for use only in verifyImages rules. The following fields are available under the `image` object and may be used in a rule to reference the named fields.

* `reference`
* `referenceWithTag`
* `registry`
* `path`
* `name`
* `tag`
