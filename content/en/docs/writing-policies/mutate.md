A `mutate` rule can be used to modify matching resources and is written as either a RFC 6902 JSON Patch or a strategic merge patch.

By using a patch in the [JSONPatch - RFC 6902](http://jsonpatch.com/) format, you can make precise changes to the resource being created. A strategic merge patch is useful for controlling merge behaviors on elements with lists. Regardless of the method, a `mutate` rule is used when an object needs to be modified in a given way.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
Kubernetes disallows changes to certain fields in resources including `name`, `namespace`, `uid`, `kind`, and `apiVersion`, therefore you cannot use Kyverno policy to effect any of these fields either during admission or once a resource has been persisted.
{{% /alert %}}

Resource mutation occurs before validation, so the validation rules should not contradict the changes performed by the mutation section. To mutate existing resources in addition to those subject to AdmissionReview requests, use [mutateExisting](#mutate-existing-resources) policies.

This policy sets the `imagePullPolicy` to `IfNotPresent` if the image tag is `latest`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: set-image-pull-policy
spec:
  rules:
    - name: set-image-pull-policy
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - Pod
      mutate:
        patchStrategicMerge:
          spec:
            containers:
              # match images which end with :latest
              - (image): "*:latest"
                # set the imagePullPolicy to "IfNotPresent"
                imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
```

## RFC 6902 JSONPatch

A [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/), implemented as a mutation method called `patchesJson6902`, provides a precise way to mutate resources and supports the following operations (in the `op` field):

* `add`
* `replace`
* `remove`

The `patchesJson6902` method can be useful when a specific mutation is needed which cannot be performed by `patchesStrategicMerge`. For example, when needing to mutate a specific object within an array, the index can be specified as part of a `patchesJson6902` mutation rule.

One distinction between this and other mutation methods is that `patchesJson6902` does not support the use of conditional anchors. Use [preconditions](preconditions.md) instead. Also, mutations using `patchesJson6902` to Pods directly are not converted to higher-level controllers such as Deployments and StatefulSets through the use of the [auto-gen feature](autogen.md). Therefore, when writing such mutation rules for Pods, it may be necessary to create multiple rules to cover all relevant Pod controllers.

This patch policy adds, or replaces, entries in a ConfigMap with the name `config-game` in any Namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-patch-cm
spec:
  rules:
    - name: pCM1
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            names:
              - config-game
            kinds:
              - ConfigMap
      mutate:
        patchesJson6902: |-
          - path: "/data/ship.properties"
            op: add
            value: |
              type=starship
              owner=utany.corp
          - path: "/data/newKey1"
            op: add
            value: newValue1
```

If your ConfigMap has empty data, the following policy adds an entry to `config-game`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-add-cm
spec:
  rules:
    - name: pCM1
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            names:
              - config-game
            kinds:
            - ConfigMap
      mutate:
        patchesJson6902: |-
          - path: "/data"
            op: add
            value:
              ship.properties: '{"type": "starship", "owner": "utany.corp"}'
```

This is an example of a patch that removes a label from a Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-remove-label
spec:
  rules:
    - name: remove-unwanted-label
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - Secret
      mutate:
        patchesJson6902: |-
          - path: "/metadata/labels/purpose"
            op: remove
```

This policy rule adds elements to a list. In this case, it adds a new busybox container and a command. Note that because the `path` statement is a precise schema element, this will only work on a direct Pod and not higher-level objects such as Deployments. Testing the below policy requires setting `spec.automountServiceAccountToken: false` in a Pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: insert-container
spec:
  rules:
  - name: insert-container
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    mutate:
      patchesJson6902: |-
        - op: add
          path: "/spec/containers/1"
          value:
            name: busybox
            image: busybox:latest
        - op: add
          path: "/spec/containers/1/command"
          value:
          - ls
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}}
Mutations using `patchesJson6902` which match on Pods are not translated to higher-level Pod controllers as noted above.
{{% /alert %}}

When needing to append an object to an array of objects, for example in `pod.spec.tolerations`, use a dash (`-`) at the end of the path.

```yaml
mutate:
  patchesJson6902: |-
    - op: add
      path: "/spec/tolerations/-"
      value:
        key: networkzone
        operator: Equal
        value: dmz
        effect: NoSchedule
```

JSON Patch uses [JSON Pointer](http://jsonpatch.com/#json-pointer) to reference keys, and keys with tilde (`~`) and forward slash (`/`) characters need to be escaped with `~0` and `~1`, respectively. For example, the following adds an annotation with the key of `config.linkerd.io/skip-outbound-ports` with the value of `"8200"`.

```yaml
- op: add
  path: /spec/template/metadata/annotations/config.linkerd.io~1skip-outbound-ports
  value: "8200"
```

Some other capabilities of the `patchesJson6902` method include:

* Adding non-existent paths
* Adding non-existent arrays
* Adding an element to the end of an array (use negative index `-1`)

## Strategic Merge Patch

The `kubectl` command uses a [strategic merge patch](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-api-machinery/strategic-merge-patch.md) with special directives to control element merge behaviors. The `patchStrategicMerge` overlay resolves to a partial resource definition.

This policy adds a new container to the Pod, sets the `imagePullPolicy`, adds a command, and sets a label with the key of `name` and value set to the name of the Pod from AdmissionReview data. Once again, the overlay in this case names a specific schema path which is relevant only to a Pod and not higher-level resources like a Deployment.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: strategic-merge-patch
spec:
  rules:
  - name: set-image-pull-policy-add-command
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            name: "{{request.object.metadata.name}}"
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: nginx
              image: nginx:latest
              imagePullPolicy: Never
              command:
              - ls
```

Note that when using `patchStrategicMerge` to mutate the `pod.spec.containers[]` array, the `name` key must be specified as a conditional anchor (i.e., `(name): "*"`) in order for the merge to occur on other fields.

Mutate rules written with this style, if they match exclusively on a Pod, are subject to [auto-generation rules](autogen.md) for Pod controllers.

## Conditional logic using anchors

Like with `validate` rules, conditional anchors are supported on `mutate` rules. Refer to the [anchors section](validate.md#anchors) for more general information on conditionals.

An **anchor** field, marked by parentheses and an optional preceding character, allows conditional processing for mutations.

The mutate overlay rules support three types of anchors:

| Anchor             | Tag  | Behavior                                             |
|--------------------|----- |----------------------------------------------------- |
| Conditional        | ()   | Use the tag and value as an "if" condition           |
| Add if not present | +()  | Add the tag value if the tag is not already present. Not to be used for arrays/lists unless inside a [`foreach`](#foreach) statement.  |
| Global             | <()  | Add the pattern when the global anchor is true       |

The **anchors** values support **wildcards**:

1. `*` - matches zero or more alphanumeric characters
2. `?` - matches a single alphanumeric character

Conditional anchors are only supported with the `patchStrategicMerge` mutation method.

### Conditional anchor

Conditional anchors are used to control when a mutation should occur by using an "if" logical evaluation, for example if a field is not already present or if a value is not the desired value. Contrast this with the example from the strategic merge patch section [above](#strategic-merge-patch) where the mutation is applied regardless of any conditions.

A conditional anchor evaluates to `true` if the anchor tag exists and if the value matches the specified value. Processing stops if a tag does not exist or when the value does not match. Once processing stops, any child elements or any remaining siblings in a list will not be processed.

For example, this will add or replace the value `6443` for the `port` field, for all ports with a name value that starts with "secure".

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-set-port
spec:
  rules:
  - name: set-port
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds :
            - Endpoints
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        subsets:
        - ports:
          - (name): "secure*"
            port: 6443
```

If the anchor tag value is an object or array, the entire object or array must match. In other words, the entire object or array becomes part of the "if" clause. Nested conditional anchor tags are not supported.

### Add if not present anchor

One of the most common scenarios when mutating resources is to add/change a field to a specified value only if it is not already present. This is done by using the **add** anchor (short for "add if not present" anchor) with the notation `+(...)` for the tag.

Typically, every non-anchor tag-value is applied as part of the mutation. If the add anchor is set on a tag, the tag and value are only applied if they do not exist in the resource. If the tag is already present then the mutation is not applied. This anchor should only be used on lists/arrays if inside a `foreach` loop as it is not intended to be an iterator. See the foreach section [below](#foreach) for an example.

In this example, the label `lfx-mentorship` will be assigned to ConfigMaps with a value of `kyverno` but _only_ if the label is not already present.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: lfx-add-labels
spec:
  rules:
  - name: lfx-mentorship
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - ConfigMap
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            +(lfx-mentorship): kyverno
```

Multiple of these add anchors may also be combined in the same rule definition when they are used as siblings. Take this example which adds fields to the securityContext of a Pod if they are not found.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: add-default-securitycontext
spec:
  rules:
  - name: add-default-securitycontext
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        spec:
          securityContext:
            +(runAsNonRoot): true
            +(runAsUser): 1000
            +(runAsGroup): 3000
            +(fsGroup): 2000
```

### Global Anchor

Similar to validate rules, mutate rules can use the global anchor. When a global anchor is used, the condition inside the anchor, when true, means the rest of the pattern will be applied regardless of how it may relate to the global anchor.

For example, the below policy will add an imagePullSecret called `my-secret` to any Pod if it has a container image beginning with `corp.reg.com`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: add-imagepullsecrets
spec:
  rules:
  - name: add-imagepullsecret
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        spec:
          containers:
          - <(image): "corp.reg.com/*"
          imagePullSecrets:
          - name: my-secret
```

The below Pod meets this criteria and so the imagePullSecret called `my-secret` is added.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: static-web
  labels:
    role: myrole
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: corp.reg.com/nginx
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: my-secret
      ports:
        - name: web
          containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
```

### Processing flow and combinations

The anchor processing behavior for mutate conditions is as follows:

1. First, all conditional anchors are processed. Processing stops when the first conditional anchor returns a `false`. Mutation proceeds only if all conditional anchors return a `true`. Note that for conditional anchor tags with complex (object or array) values, the entire value (child) object is treated as part of the condition as explained above.

2. Next, all tag-values without anchors and all add anchor tags are processed to apply the mutation.

Anchors may also be combined in mutate rules for more control and flexibility.

For example, this policy combines the global and add anchors to mutate pods containing an `emptyDir` volume to add the `cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict` annotation if it is not specified.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: add-safe-to-evict
  annotations:
    pod-policies.kyverno.io/autogen-controllers: none
spec:
  rules:
  - name: annotate-empty-dir
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          annotations:
            +(cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict): true
        spec:
          volumes:
          - <(emptyDir): {}
```

## Mutate Existing resources

In addition to standard mutations, Kyverno also supports mutation on existing resources with `patchStrategicMerge` and `patchesJson6902`. Unlike regular mutate policies that are applied through the AdmissionReview process, mutate existing policies are applied in the background (via the background controller) which update existing resources in the cluster. These "mutate existing" policies, like traditional mutate policies, are still triggered via the AdmissionReview process but apply to existing resources. This decoupling also allows triggering on one resource and mutating a totally different one. They may also optionally be configured to apply upon updates to the policy itself. This has two important implications:

1. Mutation for existing resources is an asynchronous process. This means there will be a variable amount of delay between the period where the trigger was observed and the existing resource was mutated.
2. Custom permissions are almost always required. Because these mutations occur on existing resources and not an AdmissionReview (which does not yet exist), Kyverno may need additional permissions which it does not have by default. See the section on [customizing permissions](../installation/customization.md#customizing-permissions) on how to grant additional permission to the Kyverno background controller's ServiceAccount to determine, prior to installing mutate existing rules, if additional permissions are required. Kyverno will perform these permissions checks at the time a mutate existing policy is installed. Missing or incorrect permissions will result in failure to create the policy.

To define such a policy, trigger resources need to be specified in the `match` block. The target resources--resources targeted for mutation--are specified in each mutate rule under `mutate.targets`. Note that all target resources within a single rule must share the same definition schema. For example, a mutate existing rule fails if this rule mutates both `Pod` and `Deployment` as they do not share the same OpenAPI V3 schema (except `metadata`).

Because the `match` and `mutate.targets[]` stanzas have two separate scopes, when wishing to match on and mutate the same kind of resources any exclusionary conditions must be placed in the correct scope. Match filter criteria do not implicitly function as the input filter for target selection. For example, wishing to match on and mutate existing Ingress resources which have the annotation `corp.org/facing=internal` should at least have the annotation as a selection criteria in the targets section and may use either anchors or preconditions as described further below. Placing this annotation in the `match` clause will only result in Kyverno triggering upon those resources and not necessarily mutating them.

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}}
Mutation of existing Pods is limited to mutable fields only. See the Kubernetes [documentation here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#pod-update-and-replacement) for more details.

This policy, which matches when the trigger resource named `dictionary-1` in the `staging` Namespace changes, writes a label `foo=bar` to the target resource named `secret-1` also in the `staging` Namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: mutate-existing-secret
spec:
  rules:
    - name: mutate-secret-on-configmap-event
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - ConfigMap
            names:
            - dictionary-1
            namespaces:
            - staging
      mutate:
        targets:
        - apiVersion: v1
          kind: Secret
          name: secret-1
          namespace: "{{ request.object.metadata.namespace }}"
        patchStrategicMerge:
          metadata:
            labels:
              foo: bar
```

By default, the above policy will not be applied when it is installed. This behavior can be configured via `mutateExistingOnPolicyUpdate` attribute. If you set `mutateExistingOnPolicyUpdate` to `true`, Kyverno will mutate the existing secret on policy CREATE and UPDATE AdmissionReview events.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: mutate-existing-secret
spec:
  mutateExistingOnPolicyUpdate: true
  rules:
    - name: mutate-secret-on-configmap-event
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - ConfigMap
            names:
            - dictionary-1
            namespaces:
            - staging
...
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}}
Installation of a mutate existing policy affects the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` Kyverno manages as opposed to traditional mutate rules affecting the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`.
{{% /alert %}}

When defining a list of `targets[]`, the fields `name` and `namespace` are not strictly required but encouraged. If omitted, it implies a wildcard (`"*"`) for the omitted field which can have unintended impact on other resources.

In order to more precisely control the target resources, mutate existing rules support both [context variables](external-data-sources.md) and [preconditions](preconditions.md). Preconditions which occur inside the `targets[]` array must use the target prefix as described [below](#variables-referencing-target-resources).

This sample below illustrates how to combine preconditions and conditional anchors within `targets[]` to precisely select the desired existing resources for mutation. This policy restarts existing Deployments if they are consuming a Secret that has been updated assigned label `kyverno.io/watch: "true"` AND have a name beginning with `testing-`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: refresh-env-var-in-pods
spec:
  mutateExistingOnPolicyUpdate: false
  rules:
  - name: refresh-from-secret-env
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Secret
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              kyverno.io/watch: "true"
          operations:
          - UPDATE
    mutate:
      targets:
        - apiVersion: apps/v1
          kind: Deployment
          namespace: "{{request.namespace}}"
          preconditions:
            all:
            - key: "{{target.metadata.name}}"
              operator: Equals
              value: testing-*
      patchStrategicMerge:
        spec:
          template:
            metadata:
              annotations:
                corp.org/random: "{{ random('[0-9a-z]{8}') }}"
            spec:
              containers:
              - env:
                - valueFrom:
                    secretKeyRef:
                      <(name): "{{ request.object.metadata.name }}"
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}}
The targets matched by a mutate existing rule are not subject to Kyverno's [resource filters](../installation/customization.md#resource-filters). Always develop and test rules in a sandboxed cluster to ensure the scope is correctly confined.
{{% /alert %}}

Mutate existing rules are force reconciled every hour by default regardless of the `mutateExistingOnPolicyUpdate` value. The reconciliation interval can be customized through use of the environment variable `BACKGROUND_SCAN_INTERVAL` set on the background controller.

### Variables Referencing Target Resources

To reference data in target resources, you can define the variable `target` followed by the path to the desired attribute. For example, using `target.metadata.labels.env` references the label `env` in the target resource.

This policy copies the ConfigMaps' value `target.data.key` to their label with the key `env`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: sync-cms
spec:
  mutateExistingOnPolicyUpdate: false
  rules:
  - name: concat-cm
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - ConfigMap
          names:
          - cmone
          namespaces:
          - foo
    mutate:
      targets:
        - apiVersion: v1
          kind: ConfigMap
          name: cmtwo
          namespace: bar
        - apiVersion: v1
          kind: ConfigMap
          name: cmthree
          namespace: bar
      patchesJson6902: |-
        - op: add
          path: "/metadata/labels/env"
          value: "{{ target.data.key }}"  
```

The `{{ @ }}` special variable is added to reference the in-line value of the target resource.

This policy adds the value of `keyone` from the trigger ConfigMap named `cmone` in the `foo` Namespace as the prefix to target ConfigMaps in their data with `keynew`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy

Once a mutate existing policy is applied successfully, there will be an event and an annotation added to the target resource:

```sh
$ kubectl describe deploy foobar
...

```

To troubleshoot policy application failure, inspect the `UpdateRequest` Custom Resource to get details. Successful `UpdateRequests` may be automatically cleaned up by Kyverno.

For example, if the corresponding permission is not granted to Kyverno, you should see a value of `Failed` in the `updaterequest.status` field, however a permission check is performed when a policy is installed.

```
$ kubectl get ur -n kyverno

```

### Mutate Existing Tips

Combine multiple generate existing rules into a single rule when they mutate the same resource. When these rules are combined, only a single mutation happens which is quicker and more efficient. Otherwise, by using separate rules, multiple UpdateRequests may be created as Kyverno attempts to reconcile changes from both rules simultaneously. This can take longer, require more processing resources, and in some extreme instances can fail.

## Mutate Rule Ordering (Cascading)

In some cases, it might be desired to have multiple levels of mutation rules apply to incoming resources. The `match` statement in rule A would apply a mutation to the resource, and the result of that mutation would trigger a `match` statement in rule B that would apply a second mutation. In such cases, Kyverno can accommodate more complex mutation rules, however rule ordering matters to guarantee consistent results.

For example, assume you wished to assign a label to each incoming Pod describing the type of application it contained. For those with an `image` having the string either `cassandra` or `mongo` you wished to apply the label `type=database`. This could be done with the following sample policy.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: database-type-labeling
spec:
  rules:
    - name: assign-type-database
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - Pod
      mutate:
        patchStrategicMerge:
          metadata:
            labels:
              type: database
          spec:
            (containers):
            - (image): "*cassandra* | *mongo*"
```

Also, assume that for certain application types a backup strategy needs to be defined. For those applications where `type=database`, this would be designated with an additional label with the key name of `backup-needed` and value of either `yes` or `no`. The label would only be added if not already specified since operators can choose if they want protection or not. This policy would be defined like the following.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: database-backup-labeling
spec:
  rules:
    - name: assign-backup-database
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Pod
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                type: database
      mutate:
        patchStrategicMerge:
          metadata:
            labels:
              +(backup-needed): "yes"
```

In such a case, Kyverno is able to perform cascading mutations whereby an incoming Pod that matched in the first rule and was mutated would potentially be further mutated by the second rule. In these cases, the rules must be ordered from top to bottom in the order of their dependencies and stored within the same policy. The resulting policy definition would look like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: database-protection
spec:
  rules:
  - name: assign-type-database
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            type: database
        spec:
          (containers):
          - (image): "*cassandra* | *mongo*"
  - name: assign-backup-database
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              type: database
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            +(backup-needed): "yes"
```

Test the cascading mutation policy by creating a Pod using the Cassandra image.

```sh
$ kubectl run cassandra --image=cassandra:latest
pod/cassandra created
```

Perform a `get` or `describe` on the Pod to see the result of the metadata.

```sh
$ kubectl describe po cassandra
Name:         cassandra
Namespace:    default
<snip>
Labels:       backup-needed=yes
              run=cassandra
              type=database
<snip>
```

As can be seen, both `type=database` and `backup-needed=yes` were applied according to the mutation rules.

Verify that applying your own `backup-needed` label with the value of `no` triggers the first mutation rule but not the second.

```sh
$ kubectl run cassandra --image=cassandra:latest --labels backup-needed=no
```

Perform another `get` or `describe` to verify the `backup-needed` label was not altered by the mutation rule.

```sh
$ kubectl describe po cassandra
Name:         cassandra
Namespace:    default
<snip>
Labels:       backup-needed=no
              type=database
<snip>
```

## Combining Mutate and Generate

In some use cases, it may be necessary to perform a mutation as a follow-on action from a Kyverno generate rule. In these cases, you can combine generation with mutation to achieve the desired effect. Some use cases for this include mutating a cloned resource to add fields not present in the source and performing a mutation of an existing resource in response to a generate rule.

When combining "standard" mutation and generation behaviors, order the rules in a single policy such that the generate occurs first followed by the mutate.

In the below policy, a Secret named `regcred` is generated into a newly-created Namespace followed by the addition of the `foo: bar` label on the generated Secret.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: sync-secrets
spec:
  rules:
  - name: sync-image-pull-secret
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Namespace
    generate:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      name: regcred
      namespace: "{{request.object.metadata.name}}"
      synchronize: true
      clone:
        namespace: default
        name: regcred
  - name: mutate-secret
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Secret
          names:
          - regcred
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            foo: bar
```

When combining a generation with a mutation on an existing resource, the Kyverno background controller must be instructed to not filter out the request from the previous rule. By default, these internal requests are disregarded as a form of loop protection. Set the rule-level field `skipBackgroundRequests: false` in such cases so the background controller processes the request from the generate rule before it. You will be responsible for ensuring your policy and rule combinations do not result in a loop. This step was not necessary in the previous use case because the admission controller was responsible for processing the "standard" mutate rule during admission review.

In the below policy, a ConfigMap is generated into a newly-created Namespace. A follow-on Kyverno mutate existing rule is used to mark the Namespace as "ready" via a label only once the resource has been successfully created. Note that the `skipBackgroundRequests: false` field is present on the mutate existing rule and not the generate rule.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: demo-cluster-policy
spec:
  mutateExistingOnPolicyUpdate: false
  rules:
  - name: demo-generate
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Namespace
          operations:
          - CREATE
    generate:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ConfigMap
      name: somecustomcm
      namespace: "{{request.object.metadata.name}}"
      synchronize: false
      data:
        metadata:
          labels:
            custom/related-namespace: "{{request.object.metadata.name}}"
        data:
          key: value
  - name: demo-mutate-existing
    skipBackgroundRequests: false
    match:
      all:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - ConfigMap
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                custom/related-namespace: "?*"
    mutate:
      targets:
        - apiVersion: v1
          kind: Namespace
          name: '{{ request.object.metadata.labels."custom/related-namespace" }}'
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            custom/namespace-ready: "true"
```

## foreach

A `foreach` declaration can contain multiple entries to process different sub-elements e.g. one to process a list of containers and another to process the list of initContainers in a Pod.

A `foreach` must contain a `list` attribute that defines the list of elements it processes and either a `patchStrategicMerge` or `patchesJson6902` declaration. For example, iterating over the list of containers in a Pod is performed using this `list` declaration:

```yaml
list: request.object.spec.containers
patchStrategicMerge:
  spec:
    containers:
      ...
```

When a `foreach` is processed, the Kyverno engine will evaluate `list` as a JMESPath expression to retrieve zero or more sub-elements for further processing. The value of the `list` field may also resolve to a simple array of strings, for example as defined in a context variable. The value of the `list` field should not be enclosed in braces even though it is a JMESPath expression.

`foreach` statements may also declare an optional `order` field for controlling whether to iterate over the `list` results in ascending or descending order.

A variable `element` is added to the processing context on each iteration. This allows referencing data in the element using `element.<name>` where name is the attribute name. For example, using the list `request.object.spec.containers` when the `request.object` is a Pod allows referencing the container image as `element.image` within a `foreach`.

Each `foreach` declaration can optionally contain the following declarations:

* [Context](external-data-sources.md): to add additional external data only available per loop iteration.
* [Preconditions](preconditions.md): to control when a loop iteration is skipped.
* `foreach`: a nested `foreach` declaration described below.

For a `patchesJson6902` type of `foreach` declaration, an additional variable called `elementIndex` is made available which allows the current index number to be referenced in a loop.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: foreach-json-patch
spec:
  rules:
    - name: add-security-context
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Pod
            operations:
              - CREATE
      mutate:
        foreach: 
        - list: "request.object.spec.containers"
          patchesJson6902: |-
            - path: /spec/containers/{{elementIndex}}/securityContext
              op: add
              value:
                runAsNonRoot: true
```

For a complete example of the `patchStrategicMerge` method that mutates the image to prepend the address of a trusted registry, see below.

```yaml
apiVersion : kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: prepend-registry
spec:
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: prepend-registry-containers
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
          operations:
          - CREATE
          - UPDATE
    mutate:
      foreach:
      - list: "request.object.spec.containers"
        patchStrategicMerge:
          spec:
            containers:
            - name: "{{ element.name }}"           
              image: registry.io/{{ images.containers."{{element.name}}".name}}:{{images.containers."{{element.name}}".tag}}
```

Note that the `patchStrategicMerge` is applied to the `request.object`. Hence, the patch needs to begin with `spec`. Since container names may have dashes in them (which must be escaped), the `{{element.name}}` variable is specified in double quotes.

Loops which use the `patchStrategicMerge` method may also use conditional anchors as mentioned earlier. This policy uses the add [anchor](#add-if-not-present-anchor) inside a loop to add the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` field with a value set to `false` but only if it isn't present first. The conditional around the `name` field is required in this style of mutation.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: pss-migrate
spec:
  rules:
  - name: set-allowprivescalation
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    mutate:
      foreach:
      - list: "request.object.spec.containers[]"
        patchStrategicMerge:
          spec:
            containers:
            - (name): "{{ element.name }}"
              securityContext:
                +(allowPrivilegeEscalation): false
```

As with conditional mutations outside the context of a loop, so too may multiple anchors be used inside, for example with this policy to add default resource requests to containers within a Pod if they are not specified.

```yaml
apiVersion : kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: add-default-resources
spec:
  rules:
  - name: add-default-requests
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    preconditions:
      any:
      - key: "{{request.operation || 'BACKGROUND'}}"
        operator: AnyIn
        value:
        - CREATE
        - UPDATE
    mutate:
      foreach:
      - list: "request.object.spec.containers[]"
        patchStrategicMerge:
          spec:
            containers:
            - (name): "{{element.name}}"
              resources:
                requests:
                  +(memory): "100Mi"
                  +(cpu): "100m"
```

It is important to understand internally how Kyverno treats `foreach` rules. Some general statements to keep in mind:

* No internal patches are produced until all `foreach` iterations are complete.
* `foreach` supports multiple loops but will be processed in declaration order and not independently or in parallel. The results of the first loop will be available internally to subsequent loops.
* Cascading mutations as separate rules will be necessary for a mutation to be further mutated by other logic.
* Use of the `order` field is required in some situations, for example when removing elements from an array use `Descending`.

### Nested foreach

The `foreach` object also supports nesting multiple foreach declarations to form loops within loops. This is especially useful when the mutations you need to perform are either replacements or removals as these require the use of JSON patches (`patchesJson6902`). When using nested loops, the special variable `{{elementIndex}}` requires a loop number to identify which element to process. Preconditions are supported only at the top-level loop and not per inner loop.

For example, consider a scenario in which you must replace all host names which end in `old.com` with `new.com` in an Ingress resource under the `spec.tls[].hosts[]` list. Because `spec.tls[]` is an array of objects, and `hosts[]` is an array of strings within each object, a `foreach` declaration must iterate over each object in the `tls[]` array and then internally loop over each host in the `hosts[]` array.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myingress
  labels:
    app: myingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myhost.corp.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service: 
            name: myservice
            port: 
              number: 8080
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - foo.old.com
    - bar.old.com
    secretName: mytlscertsecret
```

This type of advanced mutation can be performed with nested foreach loops as shown below. Notice that in the JSON patch, the `path` value references the current index of `tls[]` as `{{elementIndex0}}` and the current index of `hosts[]` as `{{elementIndex1}}`. In the `value` field, the `{{element}}` variable still references the current value of the `hosts[]` array being processed.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: replace-image-registry
spec:
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: replace-dns-suffix
      match:
        any:
          - resources:
              kinds:
                - Ingress
      mutate:
        foreach:
          - list: request.object.spec.tls[]
            foreach:
              - list: "element.hosts"
                patchesJson6902: |-
                  - path: /spec/tls/{{elementIndex0}}/hosts/{{elementIndex1}}
                    op: replace
                    value: "{{ replace_all('{{element}}', '.old.com', '.new.com') }}"
```

## GitOps Considerations

It is very common to use Kyverno in a GitOps approach where policies and/or other resources, which may be affected by those policies, are deployed via a state held in git by a separate tool such as Argo CD or Flux. In the case of mutations, the classic problem which arises is Kyverno (or some other tool) mutates a resource which was created by a GitOps tool. The mutation changes the resource in a way which causes divergence from the state held in git. When this divergence is detected by the GitOps controller, said controller attempts to reconcile the resource to bring it back into alignment with the desired state held in git. This process continues in an endless loop and creates "fighting" between the mutating admission controller and the GitOps controller. This type of fighting is problematic as it increases churn in the cluster, increases resource consumption by the respective tools, and can lead to disruption if it occurs on a large scale.

While Kyverno can interoperate with GitOps solutions when mutate rules are used, there are a few considerations of which to be aware and some recommended configurations.

### Flux

[Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) uses server-side apply along with dry-run mode when calculating a diff to determine if the actual state has diverged from desired state. Because Kyverno supports mutations in dry-run mode, the resource returned to Flux in this mode already includes the result of any would-be mutations. As a result, Flux natively accommodates mutating admission controllers such as Kyverno usually without any modifications needed. It is not necessary to inform Flux of the nature and number of mutations to expect for a given resource.

However, as dry-run mode causes mutation webhooks to be invoked just as if not in dry-run mode, this produces additional load on Kyverno as it must perform the same mutations every time a diff is calculated. The Flux synchronization interval should be checked and balanced to ensure only the minimal amount of processing overhead is introduced.

### ArgoCD

See the [platform notes](../installation/platform-notes.md#notes-for-argocd-users) page for general recommendations with Argo CD first.

#### ArgoCD v2.10+

ArgoCD version 2.10 added support for [sever side diff](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/diff-strategies/#server-side-diff) which leverage the Kubernetes Server Side Apply feature.

Enabling SSA based diffs, requires an annotation to be specified on the application or globally via the “argocd-cmd-params-cm” config map.

Here is a YAML fragment that shows the annotation in an ArgoCD Application resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/compare-options: ServerSideDiff=true,IncludeMutationWebhook=true 

    ...

```

This [CNCF blog post](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/01/18/gitops-and-mutating-policies-the-tale-of-two-loops/) provides a complete example.


#### ArgoCD v2.9 and below 

In order to use older versions of Argo CD with Kyverno Mutate policy rules, it will require configuring the `Application` custom resource with one or more `ignoreDifferences` entries to [instruct Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/diffing/) to ignore the mutations created by Kyverno. Some of these options include `jqPathExpressions`, `jsonPointers`, and `managedFieldsManagers`. For example, if a Kyverno mutate rule is expected to add a label `foo` to all Deployments, the Argo CD `Application` may need a section as follows.

```yaml
ignoreDifferences:
  - group: apps
    kind: Deployment
    jqPathExpressions:
    - .metadata.labels.foo
```

It may also be helpful to configure a `managedFieldsManagers` with a value of `kyverno` in the list to instruct Argo CD to allow Kyverno to own the fields it is mutating.
