description: The JSON query language behind Kyverno.
weight: 130
---

[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) (pronounced "James path") is a JSON query language created by James Saryerwinnie and is the language that Kyverno supports to perform more complex selections of fields and values and also manipulation thereof by using one or more [filters](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#filter-expressions). If you're familiar with `kubectl` and Kubernetes already, this might ring a bell in that it's similar to [JSONPath](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath). JMESPath can be used almost anywhere in Kyverno although is an optional component depending on the type and complexity of a Kyverno policy or rule that is being written. While many policies can be written with simple overlay patterns, others require more detailed selection and transformation. The latter is where JMESPath is useful.

While the complete specifications of JMESPath can be read on the official site's [specifications page](https://jmespath.org/specification.html), much of the specifics may not apply to Kubernetes use cases and further can be rather thick reading. This page serves as an easier guide and tutorial on how to learn and harness JMESPath for Kubernetes resources for use in crafting Kyverno policies. It should not be a replacement for the official JMESPath documentation but simply a use case specific guide to augment the already comprehensive literature.

## Getting Set Up

In order to position yourself for success with JMESPath expressions inside Kyverno policies, a few tools are recommended.

1. `kubectl`, the Kubernetes CLI [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/). While having `kubectl` is a given, it comes in handy especially when building a JMESPath expression around performing API lookups.

2. `kyverno`, the Kyverno CLI [here](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/releases) or via [krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/). Kyverno acts as a webhook (when run in-cluster) but also as a standalone CLI when run outside giving you the ability to test policies and, more recently, to test custom JMESPath filters which are endemic to only Kyverno. With the `jp` subcommand, it contains the functionality present in the upstream `jp` [CLI tool](https://github.com/jmespath/jp) and also newer capabilities. It effectively allows you to test out JMESPath expressions live in a command line interface by passing in a JSON document and seeing the results without having to repeatedly test Kyverno policies.

3. `yq`, the YAML processor [here](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq). `yq` allows reading from a Kubernetes manifest and converting to JSON, which is helpful in order to be piped to `jp` in order to test expressions. The Kyverno CLI `jp` subcommand also accepts YAML files in addition to JSON.

4. `jq`, the JSON processor [here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/). `jq` is an extremely popular tool for working with JSON documents and has its own filter ability, but it's also useful in order to format JSON on the terminal for better visuals.

## Basics

JMESPath is used when you need fine-grained selection of a document and need to perform some type of query logic against the result. For example, if in a given field you need to refer to the value of another field either in the same resource or in a different one, you'll need to use JMESPath. This sample policy performs a simple mutation on a Pod to add a new label named `appns` and set the value of it based on the value of the Namespace in which that Pod is created.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: add-labels
spec:
  rules:
  - name: add-labels
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            appns: "{{request.namespace}}"
```

JMESPath expressions in most places in Kyverno must be enclosed in double curly braces like `{{request.namespace}}`. If an expression is used as the value of a field and contains nothing else, the expression needs to be wrapped in quotes: `appns: "{{request.namespace}}"`. If the value field contains other text outside of the expression, then it can be unquoted and treated as a string but this isn't strictly required: `message: The namespace name is {{request.namespace}}`.

When building a JMESPath expression, a dot (`.`) character is called a "sub-expression" and used to descend into nested structures. In the `{{request.namespace}}` example, this expression is looking for the top-most object the key of which is called `request` and then looking for a child object the key of which is called `namespace`. Whatever the value of the `namespace` key is, it will be inserted where the expression is written. Given the below AdmissionReview snippet, which will be explained in a moment, the value that would result from the `{{request.namespace}}` expression is `foo`.

```json
{
    "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
    "kind": "AdmissionReview",
    "request": {
        "namespace": "foo"
    }
}
```

When submitting a Pod which matches the policy above, the result which gets created after Kyverno has mutated it would then look something like this.

**Incoming Pod**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
```

**Outgoing Pod**

```yaml {hl_lines=[5,6]}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
  labels:
    appns: foo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
```

Notice in the highlighted lines that the new label `appns` has been added to the Pod and the value set equal to the expression `{{request.namespace}}` which, in this instance, happened to be `foo` because it was created in the `foo` Namespace. Should this Pod be created in another Namespace called `bar`, the label would be `appns: bar`.

{{% alert title="Remember" color="primary" %}}
JMESPath, like JSONPath, is a query language _for JSON_ and, as such, it only works when fed with a JSON-encoded document. Although most work with Kubernetes resources using YAML, the API server will convert this to JSON internally and use that format when storing and sending objects to webhooks like Kyverno. This is why the program `yq` will be invaluable when building the correct expression based upon Kubernetes manifests written in YAML.

### AdmissionReview

Kyverno is an example, although there are many others, of an [admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-are-they). As the name implies, these are pieces of software which have some stake in whether a given resource is _admitted_ into the cluster or not. They may be either validating, mutating, or both. The latter applies to Kyverno as it has both capabilities. For a graphical representation of the order in which these requests make their way into Kyverno, see the [introduction page](../introduction/#how-kyverno-works).

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
As the name "admission" implies, this process only takes place when an object _does not_ already exist. Pre-existing objects have already been admitted successfully in the past and therefore do not apply here. Certain other _operations_ on pre-existing objects, however, are subject to the admissions process including examples like executing (`exec`) commands inside Pods and deleting objects but, importantly, not when reading back objects. The act of reading, getting, or listing resources does not result in an admission review process.
{{% /alert %}}

When a resource that matches the criteria of a selection statement gets sent to the Kubernetes API server, after the API server performs some basic modifications to it, it then gets sent to webhooks which have told the API server via a MutatingWebhookConfiguration or ValidatingWebhookConfiguration resource--which Kyverno creates for you based upon the policies you write--that it wishes to be informed. The API server will "wrap" the matching resource in another resource called an [AdmissionReview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#request) which contains a number of other descriptive data about that request, for example what _type_ or request this is (like a creation or deletion), the user who submitted the request, and, most importantly, the contents of the resource itself. Given the simple Pod example above that a user wishes to be created in the `foo` Namespace, the AdmissionReview request that hits Kyverno might look like following.

```json
{
    "kind": "AdmissionReview",
    "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
    "request": {
        "uid": "3d4fc6c1-7906-47d9-b7da-fc2b22353643",
        "kind": {
            "group": "",
            "version": "v1",
            "kind": "Pod"
        },
        "resource": {
            "group": "",
            "version": "v1",
            "resource": "pods"
        },
        "requestKind": {
            "group": "",
            "version": "v1",
            "kind": "Pod"
        },
        "requestResource": {
            "group": "",
            "version": "v1",
            "resource": "pods"
        },
        "name": "mypod",
        "namespace": "foo",
        "operation": "CREATE",
        "userInfo": {
            "username": "thomas",
            "uid": "404d34c4-47ff-4d40-b25b-4ec4197cdf63"
        },
        "object": {
            "kind": "Pod",
            "apiVersion": "v1",
            "metadata": {
                "name": "mypod",
                "creationTimestamp": null
            },
            "spec": {
                "containers": [
                    {
                        "name": "busybox",
                        "image": "busybox",
                        "resources": {}
                    }
                ]
            },
            "status": {}
        },
        "oldObject": null,
        "dryRun": false,
        "options": {
            "kind": "CreateOptions",
            "apiVersion": "meta.k8s.io/v1"
        }
    }
}
```

As can be seen, the full Pod is represented along with other metadata surrounding its creation.

These AdmissionReview resources serve as the most common source of data when building JMESPath expressions, specifically `request.object`. For the other data properties which can be consumed via an AdmissionReview resource, refer back to the [variables page](variables.md#variables-from-admission-review-requests).

## Formatting

Because there are various types of values in differing fields, there are differing ways values must be supplied to JMESPath expressions as inputs in order to generate not only a valid expression but produce the output desired. Specifying values in the correct format is key to this success. Values which are supported but need to be differentiated in formatting are numbers (i.e., an integer like `6` or a floating point like `6.7`), a quantity (i.e., a number with a unit of measure like `6Mi`), a duration (i.e., a number with a unit of time like `6h`), a [semver](https://semver.org/) (i.e., a version number like `1.2.3`), and others. Because Kyverno (and therefore most custom JMESPath filters built for Kyverno) is designed for Kubernetes, it is Kubernetes aware. Therefore, specifying \`6\` as an input to a filter is not the same as specifying \'6\' where the former is interpreted as "the number six" and latter as "six bytes". The _types_ which map to the possible values are either JSON or string. In JMESPath, these are [literal expression](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#literal-expressions) and [raw string literals](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#raw-string-literals). Use the table below to find how to format the type of value which should be supplied.

| Value Type   | Input Type | JMESPath Type | Formatting |
|--------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| Number       | Integer    | Literal       | backticks  |
| Quantity     | String     | Raw           | quotes     |
| Duration     | String     | Raw           | quotes     |
| Labels (map) | Object     | Literal       | backticks  |

Paths in a JMESPath expression may also need escaping or literal quoting depending on the contents. For example, in a ResourceQuota the following schema elements may be present:

```yaml
spec:
  hard:
    limits.memory: 3750Mi
    requests.cpu: "5"
```

To represent the `limits.memory` field in a JMESPath expression requires literal quoting of the key in order to avoid being interpreted as child nodes `limits` and `memory`. The expression would then be `{{ spec.hard.\"limits.memory\" }}`. A similar approach is needed when individual keys contain special characters, for example a dash (`-`). Quoting and then escaping is similarly needed there, ex., `{{ images.containers.\"my-container\".tag }}`.

Quoting of an overall JMESPath expression can also impact how it is evaluated. For fields which only contain a JMESPath expression (ex., `key: "{{ request.object.spec.template.spec.containers[].image | contains(@, 'nginx') }}"`) it is important to use double quotes on the outer expression (as shown) and single quotes for input fields of type string. Even if no JMESPath filters are used, any expression should be wrapped in double quotes to avoid unintended evaluation.

## Useful Patterns

When developing policies for Kubernetes resources, there are several patterns which are common where JMESPath can be useful. This section attempts to capture example patterns that have been observed through real world use cases and how to write JMESPath for them.

### Flattening Arrays

In many Kubernetes resources, arrays of both objects and strings are very common. For example, in Pod resources, `spec.containers[]` is an array of objects where each object in the array may optionally specify `args[]` which is an array of strings. Policy very often must be able to peer into these arrays and match a given pattern with enough flexibility to implement a sufficiently advanced level of control. The JMESPath [flatten operator](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#flatten-operator) can help to simplify these checks so writing Kyverno policy becomes less verbose and require fewer rules.

Pods may contain multiple containers and in different locations in the Pod spec, for example `ephemeralContainers[]`, `initContainers[]`, and `containers[]`. Regardless of where the container occurs, a container is still a container. And although it's possible to name each location in the spec individually, this produces rule or expression sprawl. It is often more efficient to collect all the containers together in a single query for processing. Consider the example Pod below.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  initContainers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

Assume this Pod is saved as `pod.yaml` locally, its `containers[]` may be queried using a simple JMESPath expression with help from the [Kyverno CLI](../kyverno-cli/usage/jp.md).

```sh
$ kyverno jp query -i pod.yaml "spec.containers[]"
[
  {
    "image": "busybox",
    "name": "busybox"
  },
  {
    "image": "nginx",
    "name": "nginx"
  }
]
```

The above output shows the return of an array of objects as expected where each object is the container. But by using a [multi-select list](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#multiselect-list), the `initContainer[]` array may also be parsed.

```sh
$ kyverno jp query -i pod.yaml "spec.[initContainers, containers]"
[
  [
    {
      "image": "redis",
      "name": "redis"
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      "image": "busybox",
      "name": "busybox"
    },
    {
      "image": "nginx",
      "name": "nginx"
    }
  ]
]
```

In the above, a multi-select list `spec.[initContainers, containers]` "wraps" the results of both `initContainers[]` and `containers[]` in parent array thereby producing an array consisting of multiple arrays. By using the [flatten operator](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#flatten-operator), these results can be collapsed into just a single array.

```sh
$ kyverno jp query -i pod.yaml "spec.[initContainers, containers][]"
[
  {
    "image": "redis",
    "name": "redis"
  },
  {
    "image": "busybox",
    "name": "busybox"
  },
  {
    "image": "nginx",
    "name": "nginx"
  }
]
```

With just a single array in which all containers, regardless of where they are, occur in a single hierarchy, it becomes easier to process the data for relevant fields and take action. For example, if you wished to write a policy which forbid using the image named `busybox` in a Pod, by flattening all containers it becomes easier to isolate just the `image` field. Because it does not matter where `busybox` may be found, if found the entire Pod must be rejected. Therefore, while loops or other methods may work, a more efficient method is to simply gather all containers across the Pod and flatten them.

```sh
$ kyverno jp query -i pod.yaml "spec.[initContainers, containers][].image"
[
  "redis",
  "busybox",
  "nginx"
]
```

With all of the images stored in a simple array, the values can be parsed much easier and just one expression written to contain the necessary logic.

```yaml
deny:
  conditions:
    any:
    - key: busybox
      operator: AnyIn
      value: "{{request.object.spec.[initContainers, containers][].image}}"
```

### Non-Existence Checks

It is common for a JMESPath expression to name a specific field so that its value may be acted upon. For example, in the [basics section](#basics) above, the label `appns` is written to a Pod via a mutate rule which does not contain it or is set to a different value. A Kyverno validate rule which exists to check the value of that label or any other field is commonplace. Because the schema for many Kubernetes resources is flexible in that many fields are optional, policy rules must contend with the scenario in which a matching resource does not contain the field being checked. When using JMESPath to check the value of such a field, a simple expression might be written `{{request.object.metadata.labels.appns}}`. If a resource is submitted which either does not contain any labels at all or does not contain a label with the specified key then the expression cannot be evaluated. An error is likely to result similar to `JMESPath query failed: Unknown key "labels" in path`. In these types of cases, the JMESPath expression should use a non-existence check in the form of the [OR expression](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#or-expressions) followed by a "default" value if the field does not exist. The resulting full expression which will correctly evaluate is `{{request.object.metadata.labels.appns || ''}}`. This expression reads, "take the value of the key request.object.metadata.labels.appns or, if it does not exist, set it to an empty string". Note that the value on the right side may need to be customized given the ultimate use of the value expected to be produced. This non-existence pattern can be used in almost any JMESPath expression to mitigate scenarios in which the initial query may be invalid.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
When using the OR expression, if the left side equals `null`/`nil` or a value of `false` it will cause the right side to be evaluated instead. Some fields in Kubernetes define boolean values so be aware of what effect this might have if the field is present but with a value of `false`. One way to work around this is to use `to_string()` to convert the boolean to a string.
{{% /alert %}}

### Matching Special Characters

Kyverno reserves [special behavior for wildcard characters](validate.md#wildcards) such as `*` and `?`. However, certain Kubernetes resources permit wildcards as values in various fields which are treated literally. It may be necessary to construct a policy which validates literal usage of such wildcards. Using the JMESPath [`contains()`](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#contains) filter it is possible to do so. The below policy shows how to use `contains()` to match on wildcards as literal characters.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: restrict-ingress-wildcard
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
    - name: block-ingress-wildcard
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Ingress
      validate:
        message: "Wildcards are not permitted as hosts."
        foreach:
        - list: "request.object.spec.rules"
          deny:
            conditions:
              any:
              - key: "{{ contains(element.host, '*') }}"
                operator: Equals
                value: true
```

## Custom Filters

In addition to the filters available in the upstream JMESPath library which Kyverno uses, there are also many new and custom filters developed for Kyverno's use found nowhere else. These filters augment the already robust capabilities of JMESPath to bring new functionality and capabilities which help solve common use cases in running Kubernetes. The filters endemic to Kyverno can be used in addition to any of those found in the upstream JMESPath library used by Kyverno and do not represent replaced or removed functionality.

For instructions on how to test these filters in a standalone method (i.e., outside of Kyverno policy), see the [documentation](../kyverno-cli/usage/jp.md) on the `kyverno jp` subcommand.

Information on each subcommand, its inputs and output, and specific usage instructions can be found below along with helpful and common use cases that have been identified.

### Add

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `add()` filter very simply adds two values and produces a sum. The official JMESPath library does not include most basic arithmetic operators such as add, subtract, multiply, and divide, the exception being `sum()` as documented [here](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#sum). While `sum()` is useful in that it accepts an array of integers as an input, `add()` is useful as a simplified filter when only two individual values need to be summed. Note that `add()` here is different from the `length()` [filter](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#length) which is used to obtain a _count_ of a certain number of items. Use `add()` instead when you have values of two fields you wish to add together.

`add()` is also value-aware (based on the formatting used for the inputs) and is capable of adding numbers, quantities, and durations without any form of unit conversion.

Arithmetic filters like `add()` currently accept inputs in the following formats.

* Number (ex., \`10\`)
* Quantity (ex., '10Mi')
* Duration (ex., '10h')

Note that how the inputs are enclosed determines how Kyverno interprets their type. Numbers enclosed in back ticks are scalar values while quantities and durations are enclosed in single quotes thus treating them as strings. Using the correct enclosing character is important because, in Kubernetes "regular" numbers are treated implicitly as units of measure. The number written \`10\` is interpreted as an integer or "the number ten" whereas '10' is interpreted as a string or "ten bytes". See the [Formatting](#formatting) section above for more details.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output   |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| Number             | Number             | Number   |
| Quantity or Number | Quantity or Number | Quantity |
| Duration or Number | Duration or Number | Duration |

Some specific behaviors to note:

* If a duration ('1h') and a number (\`5\`) are the inputs, the number will be interpreted as seconds resulting in a sum of `1h0m5s`.
* Because of durations being a string just like [resource quantities](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/quantity/), and the minutes unit of "m" also present in quantities interpreted as the "milli" prefix, there is no support for minutes.

**Example:** This policy denies a Pod if any of its containers specify memory requests and limits in excess of 200Mi.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: add-demo
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: add-demo
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
          operations:
          - CREATE
          - UPDATE
    validate:
      message: "The total memory defined in requests and limits must not exceed 200Mi."
      foreach:
      - list: "request.object.spec.containers"
        deny:
          conditions:
            any:
            - key: "{{ add('{{ element.resources.requests.memory || `0` }}', '{{ element.resources.limits.memory || `0` }}') }}"
              operator: GreaterThan
              value: 200Mi
```

### Base64_decode

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `base64_decode()` filter takes in a base64-encoded string and produces the decoded output similar to the tool and command `base64 --decode`. This can be useful when working with Kubernetes Secrets and deciphering their values in order to take action on them in a policy.

| Input 1 | Output   |
|---------|----------|
| String  | String   |

Some specific behaviors to note:

* Base64-encoded strings with newline characters will be printed back with them inline.

**Example:** This policy checks every container, initContainer, and ephemeralContainer in a Pod and decodes a Secret having the path `data.license` to ensure it does not refer to a prohibited license key.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: base64-decode-demo
spec:
  background: false
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
  - name: base64-decode-demo
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    preconditions:
      all:
      - key: "{{ request.object.spec.[containers, initContainers, ephemeralContainers][].env[].valueFrom.secretKeyRef || '' | length(@) }}"
        operator: GreaterThanOrEquals
        value: 1
      - key: "{{request.operation}}"
        operator: NotEquals
        value: DELETE
    validate:
      message: This license key may not be consumed by a Secret.
      foreach:
      - list: "request.object.spec.[containers, initContainers, ephemeralContainers][].env[].valueFrom.secretKeyRef"
        context:
        - name: status
          apiCall:
            jmesPath: "data.license"

        deny:
          conditions:

              operator: Equals

### Base64_encode

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `base64_encode()` filter is the inverse of the `base64_decode()` filter and takes in a regular, plaintext and unencoded string and produces a base64-encoded output similar to the tool and command `base64`. This can be useful when working with Kubernetes Secrets by encoding data into the base64 format which is the only acceptable format for Kubernetes Secrets.

| Input 1 | Output   |
|---------|----------|
| String  | String   |

**Example:** This policy generates a Secret when a new Namespace is created the contents of which is the value of an annotation named `corpkey`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: base64-encode-demo
spec:
  rules:
  - name: gen-supkey
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Namespace
    generate:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      name: sup-key
      namespace: "{{request.object.metadata.name}}"
      synchronize: false
      data:
        data:
          token: "{{ base64_encode('{{ request.object.metadata.annotations.corpkey }}') }}"
```

### Compare

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `compare()` filter is provided as an analog to the [inbuilt function to Golang](https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Compare) of the same name. It compares two strings [lexicographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order) where the first string is compared against the second. If both strings are equal, the result is `0` (ex., "a" compared to "a"). If the first is in lower lexical order than the second, the result is `-1` (ex., "a" compared to "b"). And if the first is in higher order than the second, the result is `1` (ex., "b" compared to "a"). Kyverno also has built-in [operators](preconditions.md#operators) for string comparison where `Equals` is usually the most common, and in most use cases it is more practical to use the `Equals` operator in expressions such as preconditions and `deny.conditions` blocks.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output   |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| String             | String             | Number   |

**Example:** This policy will write a new label called `dictionary` into a Service putting into order the values of two annotations if the order of the first comes before the second.

```yaml
apiVersion : kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: compare-demo
spec:
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: write-dictionary
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Service
    preconditions:
      any:
      - key: "{{ compare('{{request.object.metadata.annotations.foo}}', '{{request.object.metadata.annotations.bar}}') }}"
        operator: LessThan
        value: 0
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            dictionary: "{{request.object.metadata.annotations.foo}}-{{request.object.metadata.annotations.bar}}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Divide

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `divide()` filter performs arithmetic divide capabilities between two input fields and produces an output quotient. Like other arithmetic custom filters, it is input aware based on the type passed and, for quantities, allows auto conversion between units of measure. For example, dividing 10Mi (ten mebibytes) by 5Ki (five kibibytes) results in the value 5120 as units are first normalized and then [canceled](https://www.thoughtco.com/cancel-units-in-chemistry-metric-conversions-604149) through division. The `divide()` filter is currently under development to better account for all permutations of input types, however the below table captures the most common and practical use cases.

Arithmetic filters like `divide()` currently accept inputs in the following formats.

* Number (ex., \`10\`)
* Quantity (ex., '10Mi')
* Duration (ex., '10h')

Note that how the inputs are enclosed determines how Kyverno interprets their type. Numbers enclosed in back ticks are scalar values while quantities and durations are enclosed in single quotes thus treating them as strings. Using the correct enclosing character is important because, in Kubernetes "regular" numbers are treated implicitly as units of measure. The number written \`10\` is interpreted as an integer or "the number ten" whereas '10' is interpreted as a string or "ten bytes". See the [Formatting](#formatting) section above for more details.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output   |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| Number             | Number             | Number   |
| Quantity           | Number             | Quantity |
| Quantity           | Quantity           | Number   |
| Duration           | Number             | Duration |
| Duration           | Duration           | Number   |

**Example:** This policy will check every container in a Pod and ensure that memory limits are no more than 2.5x its requests.

```yaml
apiVersion : kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: enforce-resources-as-ratio
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Audit
  rules:
  - name: check-memory-requests-limits
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
          operations:
          - CREATE
          - UPDATE
    validate:
      message: Limits may not exceed 2.5x the requests.
      foreach:
      - list: "request.object.spec.containers"
        deny:
          conditions:
            any:
              # Set resources.limits.memory equal to zero if not present and resources.requests.memory equal to 1m rather than zero
              # to avoid undefined division error. No memory request in this case is basically the same as 1m. Kubernetes API server
              # will automatically set requests=limits if only limits is defined.
            - key: "{{ divide('{{ element.resources.limits.memory || '0' }}', '{{ element.resources.requests.memory || '1m' }}') }}"
              operator: GreaterThan
              value: 2.5
```

</p>
</details>

### Equal_fold

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `equal_fold()` filter is designed to provide text [case folding](https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod-norm/#dfn-case-folding) for two sets of strings as inputs. Case folding allows comparing two strings for equivalency where the only differences are letter cases. The return is a boolean (either `true` or `false`). For example, comparing "pizza" to "Pizza" results in `true` because other than title case on "Pizza" the strings are equivalent. Likewise with "pizza" and "pIzZa". Comparing "pizza" to "APPLE" results in `false` because even once normalized to the same case, the strings are different.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output   |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| String             | String             | Boolean  |

Related filters to `equal_fold()` are [`to_upper()`](#to_upper) and [`to_lower()`](#to_lower) which can also be used to normalize text for comparison.

**Example:** This policy will validate that a ConfigMap with a label named `dept` and the value of a key under `data` by the same name have the same case-insensitive value.

```yaml
apiVersion : kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: equal-fold-demo
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: validate-dept-label-data
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - ConfigMap
    validate:
      message: The dept label must equal the data.dept value aside from case.
      deny:
        conditions:
          any:
          - key: "{{ equal_fold('{{request.object.metadata.labels.dept}}', '{{request.object.data.dept}}') }}"
            operator: NotEquals
            value: true
```

</p>
</details>

### Image_normalize

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `image_normalize()` filter is used to output the canonical image string as it is known internally to Kyverno. This filter will render the internal values for the default image registry and tag (`latest`) if they apply to a given image. It is useful particularly in mutate rules where the full image value is needed to decide whether to mutate it. This filter cannot be tested with the Kyverno CLI because the runtime context is only available in webhook mode.

For example, assuming the value of the default registry is left at its defaults of `docker.io` and a Pod is sent to Kyverno which has a single container the value of its `image` field being only `nginx`, when run through the `image_normalize()` filter will come out `docker.io/nginx:latest`.

| Input 1            | Output   |
|--------------------|----------|
| String             | String   |

**Example:** This policy will mutate the value of the `image` field in a Pod's `containers[]` array if, after normalization, it begins with `docker.io`. The registry will be replaced with `harbor.corp.org`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: image-normalize-demo
spec:
  rules:
    - name: replace-image-registry-pod-containers
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - Pod
      mutate:
        foreach:
        - list: "request.object.spec.containers"
          patchStrategicMerge:
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: "{{ element.name }}"
                image: "{{ regex_replace_all('^docker.io/(.*)$', image_normalize('{{element.image}}'), 'harbor.corp.org/$1' )}}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Is_external_url

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `is_external_url()` filter takes a URL string and returns a boolean indicating whether the URL is external. It's especially useful for handling edge cases in Kubernetes related to internal domain names, ExternalName services pointing to external domain names, and invalid URLs. By utilizing this filter, the policy can more accurately decide whether to block or allow the creation or modification of resources based on the URL's external status. Additionally, the filter employs local server DNS resolution; if this fails, an error is returned, helping to prevent SSRF attacks.

| Input 1            | Output  |
|--------------------|---------|
| String             | boolean |

**Example:** This policy looks for a field named `test` within the data section of ConfigMaps and runs `is_external_url()` to determine if the value associated with `test` is an external URL.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: check-external-url-in-configmap
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: validate-external-url
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - ConfigMap
      validate:
        message: "ConfigMap contains an external URL."
        deny:
          conditions:
            all:
             - key: "{{ request.object.data.test | is_external_url(@) }}"
              operator: Equals
              value: true
```

</p>
</details>

### Items

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `items()` filter iterates on map keys (ex., annotations or labels) or arrays and converts them to an array of objects with key/value attributes with custom names.

For example, given the following map below

```json
{
  "team": "apple",
  "organization": "banana"
}
```

the `items()` filter can transform this into an array of objects which assigns a key and value of arbitrary name to each of the entries in the map.

```sh
$ echo '{"team" : "apple" , "organization" : "banana" }' | kyverno jp query "items(@, 'key', 'value')"
[
  {
    "key": "organization",
    "value": "banana"
  },
  {
    "key": "team",
    "value": "apple"
  }
]
```

It can also work on an input source given as an array of objects.

```sh
$ echo '[{"team" : "apple"} , {"organization" : "banana"}]' |  kyverno jp query "items(@, 'key', 'value')"
Reading from terminal input.
Enter input object and hit Ctrl+D.
# items(@, 'key', 'value')
[
  {
    "key": 0,
    "value": {
      "team": "apple"
    }
  },
  {
    "key": 1,
    "value": {
      "organization": "banana"
    }
  }
]
```

| Input 1                  | Input 2            | Input 3    | Output        |
|--------------------------|--------------------|------------|---------------|
| Map (Object) or Array    | String             | String     | Array/Object  |

Related filter to `items()` is its inverse, [`object_from_lists()`](#object_from_lists).

**Example:** This policy will take the labels on a Namespace `foobar` where a Bucket is deployed and add them as key/value elements to the `spec.forProvider.tagging.tagSet[]` array.

```yaml
apiVersion : kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-policy
spec:
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: test-rule
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Bucket
    context:
    - name: nslabels
      apiCall:
        urlPath: /api/v1/namespaces/foobar
        jmesPath: items(metadata.labels,'key','value')
    mutate:
      foreach:
      - list: "nslabels"
        patchesJson6902: |-
          - path: "/spec/forProvider/tagging/tagSet/-1"
            op: add
            value:
              key: "{{element.key}}"
              value": "{{element.value}}"
```

Given a Namespace which looks like the following

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: foobar
  labels:
    team: apple
    organization: banana
```

and a Bucket which looks like the below

```yaml
apiVersion: s3.aws.crossplane.io/v1beta1
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  name: lambda-bucket
spec:
  forProvider:
    acl: private
    locationConstraint: eu-central-1
    accelerateConfiguration:
      status: Enabled
    versioningConfiguration:
      status: Enabled
    notificationConfiguration:
      lambdaFunctionConfigurations:
        - events: ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"]
          lambdaFunctionArn: arn:aws:lambda:eu-central-1:255932642927:function:lambda
    paymentConfiguration:
      payer: BucketOwner
    tagging:
      tagSet:
        - key: s3-bucket
          value: lambda-bucket
    objectLockEnabledForBucket: false
  providerConfigRef:
    name: default
```

the final `spec.forProvider.tagging.tagSet[]` will appear as below. Note that as of Kubernetes 1.21, the [immutable label](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#automatic-labelling) with key `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` and value equal to that of the Namespace name is automatically added to all Namespaces, hence the discrepancy when comparing Namespace with Bucket resource manifests above.

```sh
$ kubectl get bucket lambda-bucket -o json | kyverno jp query "spec.forProvider.tagging.tagSet[]"
[
  {
    "key": "s3-bucket",
    "value": "lambda-bucket"
  },
  {
    "key": "kubernetes.io/metadata.name",
    "value": "foobar"
  },
  {
    "key": "organization",
    "value": "banana"
  },
  {
    "key": "team",
    "value": "apple"
  }
]
```

</details>

### Label_match

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `label_match()` filter compares two sets of Kubernetes labels (both key and value) and outputs a boolean response if they are equivalent. This custom filter is useful in that it functions similarly to how the Kubernetes API server associates one resource with another through label selectors. There may be one or multiple labels in each set. Labels may occur in any order. A response of `true` indicates all the labels (key and value) in the first input are accounted for in the second input. The second input, to which the first is compared, may have additional labels but it must have at minimum all those listed in the first input.

For example, the first collection compared to the second below results in `true` despite the ordering.

```json
{
  "dog": "lab",
  "color": "tan"
}
```

```json
{
  "color": "tan",
  "dog": "lab"
}
```

Likewise, these two below collections also result in `true` when compared because the entirety of the first is found within the second.

```json
{
  "dog": "lab",
  "color": "tan"
}
```

```json
{
  "color": "tan",
  "weight":"chonky",
  "dog": "lab"
}
```

These last two collections when compared are `false` because one of the values of one of the labels does not match what is in the first input.

```json
{
  "dog": "lab",
  "color": "tan"
}
```

```json
{
  "color": "black",
  "dog": "lab"
}
```

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output   |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| Map (Object)       | Map (Object)       | Boolean  |

**Example:** This policy checks all incoming Deployments to ensure they have a matching, preexisting PodDisruptionBudget in the same Namespace. The `label_match()` filter is used in a query to count how many PDBs have a label set matching that of the incoming Deployment.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: require-pdb
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Audit
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: require-pdb
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Deployment
          operations:
          - CREATE
    context:
    - name: pdb_count
      apiCall:
        urlPath: "/apis/policy/v1beta1/namespaces/{{request.namespace}}/poddisruptionbudgets"
        jmesPath: "items[?label_match(spec.selector.matchLabels, `{{request.object.spec.template.metadata.labels}}`)] | length(@)"
    validate:
      message: "There is no corresponding PodDisruptionBudget found for this Deployment."
      deny:
        conditions:
          any:
          - key: "{{pdb_count}}"
            operator: LessThan
            value: 1
```

</details>

### Lookup

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `lookup()` function returns the value for the given key/index in an object/array.
While the JMESPath language allows lookups with constant keys/indexes only, the `lookup()` function supports arbitrary JMESPath expressions, thus enabling _dynamic_ lookups.

**Parameters:**

| Input 1       | Input 2        | Output         |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Map (Object)  | String         | any            |
| Array         | Number         | any            |

- _Input 1_: The object or array to look into.
- _Input 2_: The key of type String to look up in the object or the index of type Number to look up in the array. Array indexes must be integer numbers.
- _Output_: The value corresponding to the key or index, or `null` if the key or index does not exist.

Examples:

| Expression | Result |
|---|---|
| ``lookup( `{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}`, `"key2"` )`` | `"value2"` |
| ``lookup( `["item0", "item1", "item2"]`, `1` )`` | `"item1"` |

**Example object lookup**

A policy denies a pod if at least one container [has an AppArmor profile](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/apparmor/) other than `runtime/default` configured via annotation `container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/<container_name>`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: lookup-demo
spec:
  rules:
  - name: demo
    match:
      all:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - v1/Pod
        namespaces:
        - lookup-demo
    validate:
      message: Using AppArmor profiles other than 'runtime/default' is forbidden
      deny:
        conditions:
          all:
          - key: |-
              request.object.spec.[initContainers,containers] || `[]`
              |
              []
              |
              [?
                (
                  lookup(
                    `{{ request.object.metadata.annotations || `{}` }}`
                    ,
                    join('', ['container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/', name])
                  )
                  || 'runtime/default'
                ) != 'runtime/default'
              ]
            operator: NotEquals
            value: []
```

**Example array lookup**

Randomly select an entry from an array:

```sh
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl kyverno jp query "lookup(@, modulo(random('[0-9]{1,6}') | parse_json(@), length(@)))"
- item1
- item2
- item3
EOF
```

### Modulo

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `modulo()` filter returns the [modulo](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic) or remainder between a division of two numbers. For example, the modulo of a division between `10` and `3` would be `1` since `3` can be divided into `10` only `3` times (equaling `9`) while producing `1` as a remainder.

Arithmetic filters like `modulo()` currently accept inputs in the following formats.

* Number (ex., \`10\`)
* Quantity (ex., '10Mi')
* Duration (ex., '10h')

Note that how the inputs are enclosed determines how Kyverno interprets their type. Numbers enclosed in back ticks are scalar values while quantities and durations are enclosed in single quotes thus treating them as strings. Using the correct enclosing character is important because, in Kubernetes "regular" numbers are treated implicitly as units of measure. The number written \`10\` is interpreted as an integer or "the number ten" whereas '10' is interpreted as a string or "ten bytes". See the [Formatting](#formatting) section above for more details.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output             |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Number             | Number             | Number             |

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
The inputs list is currently under construction.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

**Example:** This policy checks every container and ensures that memory limits are evenly divisible by its requests.

```yaml
apiVersion : kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: modulo-demo
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Audit
  rules:
  - name: check-memory-requests-limits
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
          operations:
          - CREATE
          - UPDATE
    validate:
      message: Limits must be evenly divisible by the requests.
      foreach:
      - list: "request.object.spec.containers"
        deny:
          conditions:
            any:
              # Set resources.limits.memory equal to zero if not present and resources.requests.memory equal to 1m rather than zero
              # to avoid undefined division error. No memory request in this case is basically the same as 1m. Kubernetes API server
              # will automatically set requests=limits if only limits is defined.
            - key: "{{ modulo('{{ element.resources.limits.memory || '0' }}', '{{ element.resources.requests.memory || '1m' }}') }}"
              operator: GreaterThan
              value: 0
```

### Multiply

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `multiply()` filter performs standard multiplication on two inputs producing an output product. Like other arithmetic filters, it is input aware and will produce output with appropriate units attached.

Arithmetic filters like `multiply()` currently accept inputs in the following formats.

* Number (ex., \`10\`)
* Quantity (ex., '10Mi')
* Duration (ex., '10h')

Note that how the inputs are enclosed determines how Kyverno interprets their type. Numbers enclosed in back ticks are scalar values while quantities and durations are enclosed in single quotes thus treating them as strings. Using the correct enclosing character is important because, in Kubernetes "regular" numbers are treated implicitly as units of measure. The number written \`10\` is interpreted as an integer or "the number ten" whereas '10' is interpreted as a string or "ten bytes". See the [Formatting](#formatting) section above for more details.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output   |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| Number             | Number             | Number   |
| Quantity           | Number             | Quantity |
| Duration           | Number             | Duration |

Due to the [commutative property](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic-home/multiply-divide/properties-of-multiplication/a/commutative-property-review) of multiplication, the ordering of inputs (unlike with `divide()`) is irrelevant.

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
The inputs list is currently under construction.

**Example:** This policy sets the replica count for a Deployment to a value of two times the current number of Nodes in a cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: multiply-demo
spec:
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: multiply-replicas
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - Deployment
      context:
        - name: nodecount
          apiCall:
            urlPath: "/api/v1/nodes"
            jmesPath: "items[] | length(@)"
      mutate:
        patchStrategicMerge:
          spec:
            replicas: "{{ multiply( `{{nodecount}}`,`2`) }}"
```

</details>

### Object_from_lists

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `object_from_lists()` filter takes an array of objects and, based on the selected keys, produces a map. This is essentially the inverse of the [`items()`](#items) filter.

For example, given a Pod definition that looks like the following

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: object-from-list-demo
  labels:
    foo: bar
spec:
  containers:
  - name: containername01
    image: containerimage:01
    env:
    - name: KEY
      value: "123-456-789"
    - name: endpoint
      value: "licensing.corp.org"
```

you may want to convert the `spec.containers[].env[]` array of objects into a map where each entry in the map sets the key to the `name` and the value to the `value` fields. Running this through the `object_from_lists()` filter will produce a map containing those entries.

```sh
$ kyverno jp query -i pod.yaml "object_from_lists(spec.containers[].env[].name,spec.containers[].env[].value)"
{
  "KEY": "123-456-789",
  "endpoint": "licensing.corp.org"
}
```

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output        |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Array/string       | Array/string       | Map (Object)  |

Related filter to `object_from_lists()` is its inverse, [`items()`](#items).

**Example:** This policy converts all the environment variables across all containers in a Pod to labels and adds them to that same Pod. Any existing labels will not be replaced but rather augmented with the converted list.

```yaml
apiVersion : kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: object-from-list-demo
  annotations:
    pod-policies.kyverno.io/autogen-controllers: none
spec:
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: object-from-list-rule
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    context:
    - name: envs
      variable:
        jmesPath: request.object.spec.containers[].env[]
    - name: envs_to_labels
      variable:
        jmesPath: object_from_lists(envs[].name, envs[].value)
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            "{{envs_to_labels}}"
```

Given an incoming Pod that looks like the following

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: object-from-list-demo
  labels:
    foo: bar
spec:
  containers:
  - name: containername01
    image: containerimage:01
    env:
    - name: KEY
      value: "123-456-789"
    - name: ENDPOINT
      value: "licensing.corp.org"
  - name: containername02
    image: containerimage:02
    env:
    - name: ZONE
      value: "fl-west-03"
```

after applying the policy the resulting label set on the Pod appears as shown below.

```sh
$ kubectl get pod/object-from-list-demo -o json | kyverno jp query "metadata.labels"
{
  "ENDPOINT": "licensing.corp.org",
  "KEY": "123-456-789",
  "ZONE": "fl-west-03",
  "foo": "bar"
}
```

</p>
</details>

### Parse_json

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `parse_json()` filter takes in a string of any valid encoded JSON and parses it into a fully-formed JSON object. This is useful because it allows Kyverno to access and work with string data that is stored anywhere which accepts strings as if it were "native" JSON data. Primary use cases for this filter include adding anything from snippets to whole documents as the values of labels, annotations, or ConfigMaps which should then be consumed by policy.

| Input 1            | Output   |
|--------------------|----------|
| String             | Any      |

**Example:** This policy uses the `parse_json()` filter to read a ConfigMap where a specified key contains JSON-encoded data (an array of strings in this case) and sets the supplementalGroups field of a Pod, if not already supplied, to that list.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: parse-json-demo
spec:
  rules:
  - name: parse-supplementalgroups-from-json
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    context:
    - name: gidsMap
      configMap:
        name: user-gids-map
        namespace: default
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        spec:
          securityContext:
            +(supplementalGroups): "{{ gidsMap.data.\"{{ request.object.metadata.labels.\"corp.com/service-account\" }}\" | parse_json(@)[*].to_number(@) }}"
```

The referenced ConfigMap may look similar to the below.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-gids-map
  namespace: default
data:
  finance: '["1001","1002"]'
```

</p>
</details>

### Parse_yaml

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `parse_yaml()` filter is the YAML equivalent of the [`parse_json()`](#parse_json) filter and takes in a string of any valid YAML document, serializes it into JSON, and parses it so it may be processed by JMESPath. Like `parse_json()`, this is useful because it allows Kyverno to access and work with string data that is stored anywhere which accepts strings as if it were "native" YAML data. Primary use cases for this filter include adding anything from snippets to whole documents as the values of labels, annotations, or ConfigMaps which should then be consumed by policy.

| Input 1            | Output   |
|--------------------|----------|
| String             | Any      |

**Example:** This policy parses a YAML document as the value of an annotation and uses the filtered value from a JMESPath expression in a variable substitution.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: parse-yaml-demo
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: check-goodbois
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    validate:
      message: "Only good bois allowed."
      deny:
        conditions:
        - key: "{{request.object.metadata.annotations.pets | parse_yaml(@).species.isGoodBoi }}"
          operator: NotEquals
          value: true
```

The referenced Pod may look similar to the below.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
  labels:
    app: busybox
  annotations:
    pets: |-
      species:
        dog: lab
        name: dory
        color: black
        height: 15
        isGoodBoi: false
        snacks:
        - chimken
        - fries
        - pizza
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox:1.28
```

</p>
</details>

### Path_canonicalize

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `path_canonicalize()` filter is used to normalize or canonicalize a given path by removing excess slashes. For example, a path supplied to the filter may be `/var//lib///kubelet` which will be canonicalized into `/var/lib/kubelet` which is how an operating system would interpret the former. This filter is primarily used as a circumvention protection for what would otherwise be strict string matches for paths.

| Input 1            | Output      |
|--------------------|-------------|
| String             | String      |

**Example:** This policy uses the `path_canonicalize()` filter to check the value of each `hostPath.path` field in a volume block in a Pod to ensure it does not attempt to mount the Containerd host socket.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: path-canonicalize-demo
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: disallow-mount-containerd-sock
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    validate:
      foreach:
      - list: "request.object.spec.volumes[]"
        deny:
          conditions:
            any:
            - key: "{{ path_canonicalize(element.hostPath.path) }}"
              operator: Equals
              value: "/var/run/containerd/containerd.sock"
```

</p>
</details>

### Pattern_match

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `pattern_match()` filter is used to perform a simple, non-regex match by specifying an input pattern and the string or number to which it should be compared. The output is always a boolean response. This filter can be useful when wishing to make simpler comparisons, typically with strings or numbers involved. It avoids many of the complexities of regex while still support wildcards such as `*` (zero or more characters) and `?` (any one character). Note that since Kyverno supports overlay-style patterns and wildcards, use of `pattern_match()` is typically not needed in these scenarios. This filter is more valuable in dynamic lookup scenarios by using JMESPath variables for one or both inputs as exemplified below.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output   |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| String             | String             | Boolean  |
| String             | Number             | Boolean  |

**Example:** This policy uses `pattern_match()` with dynamic inputs by fetching a pattern stored in a ConfigMap against an incoming Namespace label value.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: pattern-match-demo
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
  - match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Namespace
    name: dept-billing-check
    context:
    - name: deptbillingcodes
      configMap:
        name: deptbillingcodes
        namespace: default
    validate:
      message: The department {{request.object.metadata.labels.dept}} must supply a matching billing code.
      deny:
        conditions:
          any:
            - key: "{{pattern_match('{{deptbillingcodes.data.{{request.object.metadata.labels.dept}}}}', '{{ request.object.metadata.labels.segbill}}') }}"
              operator: Equals
              value: false
```

The ConfigMap used as the source of the patterns may look like below.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: deptbillingcodes
data:
  eng_china: 158-6?-3*
  eng_india: 158-7?-4*
  busops: 145-0?-9*
  finops: 145-1?-5*
```

And a Namespace upon which the above ClusterPolicy may act can look like below.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ind-go
  labels:
    dept: eng_india
    segbill: 158-73-417
```

</p>
</details>

### Random

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `random()` filter is used to generate a random sequence of string data based upon the input pattern, expressed as regex. The input it takes is a combination of the composition of the pattern and the length of each pattern. This filter is useful in a variety of ways including generating unique resource names. Some other use cases include creating Pod hashes, auth tokens, license keys, GUIDs, and more.

For example, `random('[0-9a-z]{5}')` will produce a string output of exactly 5 characters long composed of numbers in the collection `0-9` and lower-case letters in the collection `a-z`. The output might be `"91t6f"`. More complex random output can be created by chaining multiple pattern and length combinations together. For example, to create a faux license key you could use the expression `random('[A-Z0-9]{8}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{12}')` which may generate the output `"K284DW7Y-7LMT-XHR3-ZZ53-36366O8JVDG9"`.

| Input 1            | Output   |
|--------------------|----------|
| String             | String   |

**Example:** This policy uses `random()` to mutate a new Secret to add a label with key `randomoutput` and the value of which is `random-` followed by 6 random characters composed of lower-case letters `a-z` and numbers `0-9`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: ver-test
spec:
  rules:
  - name: test-ver-ver
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Secret
          operations:
          - CREATE
    context:
    - name: randomtest
      variable:
        jmesPath: random('[a-z0-9]{6}')
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            randomoutput: random-{{randomtest}}
```

</p>
</details>

### Regex_match

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `regex_match()` filter is similar to the [`pattern_match()`](#pattern_match) filter except it accepts standard [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) as the comparison format. The first input is the pattern, specified in regex format, while the second is the string compared to the pattern which accepts either string or number. The output is always a boolean response. For example, the following two expressions, which check to ensure a number is in the range of one to seven, both evaluate to `true`.

```
regex_match('^[1-7]$',`1`)
regex_match('^[1-7]$','1')
```

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output   |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| String             | String             | Boolean  |
| String             | Number             | Boolean  |

**Example:** This policy checks that a PersistentVolumeClaim resource contains an annotation named `backup-schedule` and its value conforms to a standard Cron expression string. Note that the regular expression in the first input has had an additional backslash added to each backslash to be valid YAML. To use this sample regex in other applications, remove one of each double backslash pair.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: regex-match-demo
spec:
  background: true
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
  - name: validate-backup-schedule-annotation-cron
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - PersistentVolumeClaim
    validate:
      message: The annotation `backup-schedule` must be present and in cron format.
      deny:
        conditions:
          any:
          - key: "{{ regex_match('^((?:\\*|[0-5]?[0-9](?:(?:-[0-5]?[0-9])|(?:,[0-5]?[0-9])+)?)(?:\\/[0-9]+)?)\\s+((?:\\*|(?:1?[0-9]|2[0-3])(?:(?:-(?:1?[0-9]|2[0-3]))|(?:,(?:1?[0-9]|2[0-3]))+)?)(?:\\/[0-9]+)?)\\s+((?:\\*|(?:[1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|3[0-1])(?:(?:-(?:[1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|3[0-1]))|(?:,(?:[1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|3[0-1]))+)?)(?:\\/[0-9]+)?)\\s+((?:\\*|(?:[1-9]|1[0-2])(?:(?:-(?:[1-9]|1[0-2]))|(?:,(?:[1-9]|1[0-2]))+)?)(?:\\/[0-9]+)?)\\s+((?:\\*|[0-7](?:-[0-7]|(?:,[0-7])+)?)(?:\\/[0-9]+)?)$', '{{request.object.metadata.annotations.\"backup-schedule\" || ''}}') }}"
            operator: Equals
            value: false
```

</p>
</details>

### Regex_replace_all

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `regex_replace_all()` filter is similar to the [`replace_all()`](#replace_all) filter only differing by the first and third inputs being a valid [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) rather than a static string. For literal replacement, see [`regex_replace_all_literal()`](#regex_replace_all_literal). If numbers are supplied for the second and third inputs, they will internally be converted to string. The output is always a string. For example, the expression `regex_replace_all('([0-9])([0-9])', 'hello im 42 months old', '${1}1')` results in the output `hello im 41 months old`. The first input provides the regex which should be used to match against the second input, and the third serves as the replacement which, in this case, replaces the first capture group from the end with the number `1`.

| Input 1                    | Input 2            | Input 3            | Output        |
|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Regex (String)             | String             | Regex (String)     | String        |
| Regex (String)             | Number             | Number             | String        |

**Example:** This policy mutates a Deployment having label named `retention` to set the last number to `0`. For example, an incoming Deployment with the label value of `days_37` would result in the value `days_30` after mutation.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: regex-replace-all-demo
spec:
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: retention-adjust
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Deployment
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            retention: "{{ regex_replace_all('([0-9])([0-9])', '{{ @ }}', '${1}0') }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Regex_replace_all_literal

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `regex_replace_all_literal()` filter is similar to the [`regex_replace_all()`](#regex_replace_all) filter with the third input being a static string used for literal replacement. If numbers are supplied for the second and third inputs, they will internally be converted to string. The output is always a string. For example, the expression `regex_replace_all_literal('^(\d{3}-?\d{2}-?\d{4})$', '123-45-6789', 'redacted')` would return `redacted` as the regex filter matches the faux social security number of `123-45-6789`.

| Input 1                    | Input 2            | Input 3            | Output        |
|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Regex (String)             | String             | String             | String        |
| Regex (String)             | Number             | Number             | String        |

**Example:** This policy replaces the image registry for each image in every container so it comes from `myregistry.corp.com`. Note that, for images without an explicit registry such as `nginx:latest`, Kyverno will internally replace this to be `docker.io/nginx:latest` and thereby ensuring the regex pattern below matches.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: regex-replace-all-literal-demo
spec:
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: replace-image-registry
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Pod
      mutate:
        foreach:
        - list: "request.object.spec.containers"
          patchStrategicMerge:
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: "{{ element.name }}"
                image: "{{ regex_replace_all_literal('^[^/]+', '{{element.image}}', 'myregistry.corp.com' )}}"
```

The `replace()` filter is similar to the [`replace_all()`](#replace_all) filter except it takes a fourth input (a number) to specify how many instances of the source string should be replaced with the replacement string in a parent. For example, the expression shown below results in the value `Lorem muspi dolor sit amet foo muspi bar ipsum` because only two instances of the string `ipsum` were requested to be replaced. String replacement begins at the left and proceeds to the right halting once the desired count has been reached. If `-1` is specified for the four input, it results in all instances of the source string being replaced (effectively the same behavior as `replace_all()`).

```
replace('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet foo ipsum bar ipsum', 'ipsum', 'muspi', `2`)
```

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Input 3            | Input 4            | Output        |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| String             | String             | String             | Number             | String        |

**Example:** This policy replaces the rule on an Ingress resource so that the path field will replace the first instance of `/cart` with `/shoppingcart`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: replace-demo
spec:
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: replace-path
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Ingress
      mutate:
        foreach:
        - list: "request.object.spec.rules[].http.paths[]"
          patchStrategicMerge:
            spec:
              rules:
              - http:
                  paths:
                  - backend:
                      service:
                        name: kuard
                        port:
                          number: 8080
                    path: "{{ replace('{{element.path}}', '/cart', '/shoppingcart', `1`) }}"
                    pathType: ImplementationSpecific
```

### Replace_all

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `replace_all()` filter is used to find and replace all instances of one string with another in an overall parent string. Input strings are assumed to be literal and do not support wildcards. For example, the expression `replace_all('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet', 'ipsum', 'muspi')` results in the value `Lorem muspi dolor sit amet` as the string `ipsum` has been replaced with `muspi`. If there were multiple instances of `ipsum` in the parent string, they would all be replaced with `muspi`.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Input 3            | Output        |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| String             | String             | String             | String        |

**Example:** This policy uses `replace_all()` to replace the string `release-name---` with the contents of the annotation `meta.helm.sh/release-name` in the `workingDir` field under a container entry within a Deployment.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: replace-all-demo
spec:
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: replace-workingdir
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Deployment
      mutate:
        patchStrategicMerge:
          spec:
            template:
              spec:
                containers:
                  - (name): "*"
                    workingDir: "{{ replace_all('{{@}}', 'release-name---', '{{request.object.metadata.annotations.\"meta.helm.sh/release-name\"}}') }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Round

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `round()` filter is used to round a number to a desired set of places. It can be useful when working with values such as currencies or measurements. For example, the expression ``round(`10.125`,`2`)`` would result in rounding the number `10.125` to two decimal places resulting in the value `10.13`. When using this filter, it may be necessary to convert inputs to the necessary type (number), most commonly string. JMESPath has a built-in filter called `to_number()` which can be used for this purpose. See the documentation [here](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#to-number) for more details.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output        |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Number             | Number             | Number        |

**Example:** This policy uses `round()` to round the result of a variable named `input` to two decimal places.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: round-demo
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
    - name: round-input
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Deployment
      context:
      - name: input
        variable:
          value: 10.123456
      validate:
        message: The rounded value is {{ round(input, `2`) }}.
        deny: {}
```

</details>

### Semver_compare

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `semver_compare()` filter compares two strings which comply with the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) schema and outputs a boolean response as to the position of the second relative to the first. The first input is the "base" semver string for comparison while the second is the version is compared against the first. The second string accepts an [operator prefix](validate.md#operators) and supports AND and OR logic. It also supports the special placeholder variable "x" in any position. For some examples, `semver_compare('1.2.3','1.2.4')` results in the output `false` because version 1.2.4 is not equal to version 1.2.3. `semver_compare('4.1.3','>=4.1.x')` results in the output `true` because 4.1.3 is greater than or equal to 4.1.x. `semver_compare('4.1.3','!4.x.x')` returns `false` because 4.1.3 is equal to 4.x.x. `semver_compare('1.8.6','>1.0.0 <2.0.0')` returns `true` because the second input is an AND expression and 1.8.6 is both greater than 1.0.0 and less than 2.0.0. And `semver_compare('2.1.5','<2.0.0 || >=3.0.0')` returns `false` because 2.1.5 is neither less than 2.0.0 nor greater than or equal to 3.0.0.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output        |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| String             | String             | Boolean       |

**Example:** This policy uses `semver_compare()` to check the attestations on a container image and denies it has been built with httpclient greater than version 4.5.0.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: semver-compare-demo
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: check-sbom
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Pod
      verifyImages:
      - image: "ghcr.io/kyverno/test-verify-image*"
        key: |-
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEHMmDjK65krAyDaGaeyWNzgvIu155
          JI50B2vezCw8+3CVeE0lJTL5dbL3OP98Za0oAEBJcOxky8Riy/XcmfKZbw==
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
        attestations:
        - predicateType: https://example.com/CycloneDX/v1
          conditions:
            - all:
              - key: "{{ components[?name == 'commons-logging'].version | [0] }}"
                operator: GreaterThanOrEquals
                value: "1.2.0"
              - key: "{{ semver_compare( {{ components[?name == 'httpclient'].version | [0] }}, '>4.5.0') }}"
                operator: Equals
                value: true
```

</p>
</details>

### Sha256

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `sha256()` filter takes a string of any length and returns a fixed hash value. For example, when `sha256()` is applied to the string `alertmanager-kube-prometheus-stack-alertmanager`, which exceeds the character limit, it returns a fixed hash value of `75c07bb807f2d80a85d34880b8af0c5f29f7c27577076ed5d0e4b427dee7dbcc`. This feature is particularly useful for situations where the length of a string surpasses Kyverno's 52-character limit. It can be employed to generate resource names and to create resources for deployments whose names are not under our control.

| Input 1            | Output  |
|--------------------|---------|
| String             | String  |

**Example:** This policy mutates the names of specified resources to their SHA256 hash values.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: sha256-demo
spec:
  rules:
    - name: convert-name-to-hash
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Pod
      mutate:
        patchStrategicMerge:
          metadata:
            name: "{{ sha256(request.object.metadata.name) }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Split

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `split()` filter is used to take in an input string, a character or sequence found within that string, and split the source into an array of strings. For example, the string `cat,dog,horse` can be split on the comma (`,`) character resulting in three separate strings in the collection `["cat","dog","horse"]`. This filter is often most useful when looping over a number of different strings within a single value and performing some comparison or expression.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output        |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| String             | String             | Array/string  |

**Example:** This policy checks an incoming Ingress to ensure its root path does not conflict with another root path in a different Namespace. It requires that incoming Ingress resources have a single rule with a single path only and assumes the root path is specified explicitly in an existing Ingress rule (ex., when blocking /foo/bar /foo must exist by itself and not part of /foo/baz).

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: split-demo
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Audit
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: check-path
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Ingress
            operations:
            - CREATE
      context:
        # Looks up the Ingress paths across the whole cluster.
        - name: allpaths
          apiCall:
            urlPath: "/apis/networking.k8s.io/v1/ingresses"
            jmesPath: "items[].spec.rules[].http.paths[].path"
        # Looks up the Ingress paths in the same Namespace where the incoming request is targeted.
        - name: nspath
          apiCall:
            urlPath: "/apis/networking.k8s.io/v1/namespaces/{{request.object.metadata.namespace}}/ingresses"
            jmesPath: "items[].spec.rules[].http.paths[].path"
      validate:
        message: >-
          The root path /{{request.object.spec.rules[].http.paths[].path | to_string(@) | split(@, '/') | [1]}}/ exists
          in another Ingress rule elsewhere in the cluster.
        deny:
          conditions:
            all:
              # Deny if the root path of the request exists somewhere else in the cluster other than the same Namespace.
              - key: /{{request.object.spec.rules[].http.paths[].path | to_string(@) | split(@, '/') | [1]}}/
                operator: In
                value: "{{allpaths}}"
              - key: /{{request.object.spec.rules[].http.paths[].path | to_string(@) | split(@, '/') | [1]}}/
                operator: NotIn
                value: "{{nspath}}"
```

### Subtract

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `subtract()` filter performs arithmetic subtraction capabilities between two input fields (terms) and produces an output difference. Like other arithmetic custom filters, it is input aware based on the type passed and, for quantities, allows auto conversion between units of measure. For example, subtracting 10Mi (ten mebibytes) minus 5Ki (five kibibytes) results in the value 10235Ki. The `subtract()` filter is currently under development to better account for all permutations of input types, however the below table captures the most common and practical use cases.

Arithmetic filters like `subtract()` currently accept inputs in the following formats.

* Number (ex., \`10\`)
* Quantity (ex., '10Mi')
* Duration (ex., '10h')

Note that how the inputs are enclosed determines how Kyverno interprets their type. Numbers enclosed in back ticks are scalar values while quantities and durations are enclosed in single quotes thus treating them as strings. Using the correct enclosing character is important because, in Kubernetes "regular" numbers are treated implicitly as units of measure. The number written \`10\` is interpreted as an integer or "the number ten" whereas '10' is interpreted as a string or "ten bytes". See the [Formatting](#formatting) section above for more details.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output   |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| Number             | Number             | Number   |
| Quantity           | Quantity           | Number   |
| Duration           | Duration           | Duration |

**Example:** This policy sets the value of a new label called `lessreplicas` to the value of the current number of replicas in a Deployment minus two so long as there are more than two replicas to start with.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: subtract-demo
spec:
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: subtract-demo
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Deployment
    preconditions:
      any:
      - key: "{{ request.object.spec.replicas }}"
        operator: GreaterThan
        value: 2
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            lessreplicas: "{{ subtract('{{ request.object.spec.replicas }}',`2`) }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Sum

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `sum()` filter takes an array of numbers, durations, or quantities and sums them together. This is a customized version of `sum()` found in the [upstream JMESPath specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#sum) but augmented to support inputs common to Kubernetes workloads, specifically durations and quantities. `sum()` is similar to `add()` with the difference that `sum()` accepts an array as an input while `add()` does not. Inputs must be of a homogenous type. For example, the query `echo '{"input":['2Ki','5Gi','8Mi']}' | kyverno jp query "sum(input)"` results in the value `"5251074Ki"`. The query `echo '{"input":['2h','50s','90s']}' | kyverno jp query "sum(input)"` results in the value `"2h2m20s"`. And the query `echo '{"input":[6,3,8]}' | kyverno jp query "sum(input)"` results in the value of `17`.

Arithmetic filters like `sum()` currently accept inputs in the following formats.

* Number (ex., \`10\`)
* Quantity (ex., '10Mi')
* Duration (ex., '10h')

See the [Formatting](#formatting) section above for more details on how inputs are expected to be supplied. Durations cannot be expressed as minutes (i.e., `"5m"`) as the "m" unit is interpreted to be millicores.

| Input 1            | Output   |
|--------------------|----------|
| Array/Number       | Number   |
| Array/Quantity     | Quantity |
| Array/Duration     | Duration |

**Example:** This policy sums the memory requests of all containers in a Pod and denies it if it exceeds 1 gibibyte (1Gi).

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: sum-demo
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
    - name: memory-requests-check
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - Pod
      validate:
        message: The sum of all memory requests in a Pod cannot exceed 1 gibibyte.
        deny:
          conditions:
            all:
            - key: "{{ sum(request.object.spec.containers[].resources.requests.memory) }}"
              operator: GreaterThan
              value: 1Gi
```

</p>
</details>

### Time_add

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `time_add()` filter is used to take a starting, absolute time in RFC 3339 format, and add some duration to it. Duration can be specified in terms of seconds, minutes, and hours. For times not given in RFC 3339, use the `time_parse()` function to convert the source time into RFC 3339.

The expression `time_add('2023-01-12T12:37:56-05:00','6h')` results in the value `"2023-01-12T18:37:56-05:00"`.

| Input 1                          | Input 2                         | Output                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Time start (String)              | Time duration (String)          | Time end (String)          |

**Example:** This policy uses `time_add()` in addition to `time_now_utc()` and `time_to_cron()` to get the current time and add four hours to it in order to write out the new schedule, in Cron format, necessary for a ClusterCleanupPolicy.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: automate-cleanup
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: cleanup
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - PolicyException
          namespaces:
          - foo
    generate:
      apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2alpha1
      kind: ClusterCleanupPolicy
      name: polex-{{ request.namespace }}-{{ request.object.metadata.name }}-{{ random('[0-9a-z]{8}') }}
      synchronize: false
      data:
        metadata:
          labels:
            kyverno.io/automated: "true"
        spec:
          schedule: "{{ time_add('{{ time_now_utc() }}','4h') | time_to_cron(@) }}"
          match:
            any:
            - resources:
                kinds:
                  - PolicyException
                namespaces:
                - "{{ request.namespace }}"
                names:
                - "{{ request.object.metadata.name }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Time_after

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `time_after()` filter is used to determine whether one absolute time is after another absolute time where both times are in RFC 3339 format. The output is a boolean response where `true` if the end time is after the begin time and `false` if it is not.

The expression `time_after('2023-01-12T14:07:55-05:00','2023-01-12T19:05:59Z')` results in the value `true`. The expression `time_after('2023-01-12T19:05:59Z','2023-01-13T19:05:59Z')` results in the value `false`.

| Input 1                          | Input 2                         | Output                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Time end (String)                | Time begin (String)             | Boolean                    |

**Example:** This policy uses `time_after()` in addition to `time_now_utc()` to deny ConfigMap creation if the current time is after the deadline for cluster decommissioning.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: decommission-policy
spec:
  background: false
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
    - name: decomm-jan-12
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - ConfigMap
      validate:
        message: "This cluster is being decommissioned and no further resources may be created after January 12th."
        deny:
          conditions:
            all:
            - key: "{{ time_after('{{time_now_utc() }}','2023-01-12T00:00:00Z') }}"
              operator: Equals
              value: true
```

</p>
</details>

### Time_before

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `time_before()` filter is used to determine whether one absolute time is before another absolute time where both times are in RFC 3339 format. The output is a boolean response where `true` if the end time is before the begin time and `false` if it is not.

The expression `time_before('2023-01-12T19:05:59Z','2023-01-13T19:05:59Z')` results in the value `true`. The expression `time_before('2023-01-12T19:05:59Z','2023-01-11T19:05:59Z')` results in the value `false`.

| Input 1                          | Input 2                         | Output                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Time end (String)                | Time begin (String)             | Boolean                    |

**Example:** This policy uses `time_before()` in addition to `time_now_utc()` to effectively set an expiration date for a policy. Up until the UTC time of 2023-01-31T00:00:00Z, the label `foo` must be present on a ConfigMap.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: expiration
spec:
  background: false
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
    - name: expire-jan-31
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - ConfigMap
      preconditions:
        all:
        - key: "{{ time_before('{{ time_now_utc() }}','2023-01-31T00:00:00Z') }}"
          operator: Equals
          value: true
      validate:
        message: "The foo label must be set."
        pattern:
          metadata:
            labels:
              foo: "?*"
```

</p>
</details>

### Time_between

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `time_between()` filter is used to check if a given time is between a range of two other times where all time is expected in RFC 3339 format.

The expression `time_between('2023-01-12T19:05:59Z','2023-01-01T19:05:59Z','2023-01-15T19:05:59Z')` results in the value `true`. The expression `time_between('2023-01-12T19:05:59Z','2023-01-01T19:05:59Z','2023-01-11T19:05:59Z')` results in the value `false`.

| Input 1                          | Input 2                         | Input 3                       | Output                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Time to check (String)           | Time start (String)             | Time end (String)             | Boolean                    |

**Example:** This policy uses `time_between()` in addition to `time_now_utc()` to establish a boundary of a policy's function. Between 1 January 2023 and 31 January 2023, the label `foo` must be present on a ConfigMap.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: expiration
spec:
  background: false
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
    - name: expire-jan-31
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - ConfigMap
      preconditions:
        all:
        - key: "{{ time_between('{{ time_now_utc() }}','2023-01-01T00:00:00Z','2023-01-31T23:59:59Z') }}"
          operator: Equals
          value: true
      validate:
        message: "The foo label must be set."
        pattern:
          metadata:
            labels:
              foo: "?*"
```

</p>
</details>

### Time_diff

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `time_diff()` filter calculates the amount of time between a start and end time where start and end are given in RFC 3339 format. The output, a string, is the duration and may be a negative duration.

The expression `time_diff('2023-01-10T00:00:00Z','2023-01-11T00:00:00Z')` results in the value `"24h0m0s"`. The expression `time_diff('2023-01-12T00:00:00Z','2023-01-11T00:00:00Z')` results in the value `"-24h0m0s"`.

| Input 1                          | Input 2                         | Output                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Time start (String)              | Time duration (String)          | Duration (String)          |

**Example:** This policy uses the `time_diff()` filter in addition to `time_now_utc()` to ensure that a vulnerability scan for a given container image is no more than 24 hours old.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: require-vulnerability-scan
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  webhookTimeoutSeconds: 20
  failurePolicy: Fail
  rules:
    - name: scan-not-older-than-one-day
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - Pod
      verifyImages:
      - imageReferences:
        - "ghcr.io/myorg/myrepo:*"
        attestations:
        - predicateType: cosign.sigstore.dev/attestation/vuln/v1
          attestors:
          - entries:
            - keyless:
                subject: "https://github.com/myorg/myrepo/.github/workflows/*"
                issuer: "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
                rekor:
                  url: https://rekor.sigstore.dev
          conditions:
          - all:
            - key: "{{ time_diff('{{metadata.scanFinishedOn}}','{{ time_now_utc() }}') }}"
              operator: LessThanOrEquals
              value: "24h"
```

</p>
</details>

### Time_now

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `time_now()` filter returns the current time in RFC 3339 format. The returned time will be presented as it is known to the Kubernetes Node itself and is not guaranteed to be in a specific time zone. There are no required inputs and the output is always an absolute time (string) in RFC 3339 format.

| Input 1                          | Output                     |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| None                             | Current time (String)      |

Also note that in addition to calling `time_now()`, for new resources the then-current time can often be retrieved via the `metadata.creationTimestamp` field.

**Example:** This policy uses the `time_now()` filter in addition to `time_add()` and `time_to_cron()` to generate a ClusterCleanupPolicy from 4 hours after the triggering PolicyException is created, converting it into cron format for use by the ClusterCleanupPolicy.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: automate-cleanup
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: cleanup
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - PolicyException
          namespaces:
          - foo
    generate:
      apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2alpha1
      kind: ClusterCleanupPolicy
      name: polex-{{ request.namespace }}-{{ request.object.metadata.name }}-{{ random('[0-9a-z]{8}') }}
      synchronize: false
      data:
        metadata:
          labels:
            kyverno.io/automated: "true"
        spec:
          schedule: "{{ time_add('{{ time_now() }}','4h') | time_to_cron(@) }}"
          match:
            any:
            - resources:
                kinds:
                  - PolicyException
                namespaces:
                - "{{ request.namespace }}"
                names:
                - "{{ request.object.metadata.name }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Time_now_utc

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `time_now_utc()` filter returns the current UTC time in RFC 3339 format. The returned time will be presented in UTC regardless of the time zone returned. There are no required inputs and the output is always an absolute time (string) in RFC 3339 format.

| Input 1                          | Output                     |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| None                             | Current time (String)      |

Also note that in addition to calling `time_now_utc()`, for new resources the then-current time can often be retrieved via the `metadata.creationTimestamp` field.

**Example:** This policy uses the `time_now_utc()` filter in addition to `time_add()` and `time_to_cron()` to generate a ClusterCleanupPolicy from 4 hours after the triggering PolicyException is created, converting it into cron format for use by the ClusterCleanupPolicy.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: automate-cleanup
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: cleanup
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - PolicyException
          namespaces:
          - foo
    generate:
      apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2alpha1
      kind: ClusterCleanupPolicy
      name: polex-{{ request.namespace }}-{{ request.object.metadata.name }}-{{ random('[0-9a-z]{8}') }}
      synchronize: false
      data:
        metadata:
          labels:
            kyverno.io/automated: "true"
        spec:
          schedule: "{{ time_add('{{ time_now_utc() }}','4h') | time_to_cron(@) }}"
          match:
            any:
            - resources:
                kinds:
                  - PolicyException
                namespaces:
                - "{{ request.namespace }}"
                names:
                - "{{ request.object.metadata.name }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Time_parse

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `time_parse()` filter converts an input time, given some other format, to RFC 3339 format. The first input is any time in the source format, the second input is the actual time to convert which is expected to be in the format specified by the first input. The output is always the second input converted to RFC 3339.

- The expression `time_parse('Mon Jan 02 2006 15:04:05 -0700', 'Fri Jun 22 2022 17:45:00 +0100')` results in the output of `"2022-06-22T17:45:00+01:00"`. 

- The expression `time_parse('2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00', '2021-01-02T15:04:05-07:00')` results in the output of `"2021-01-02T15:04:05-07:00"`.

- The expression `time_parse('1702691171', '1702691171')` (epoch time) results in the output of `"2023-12-16T01:46:11Z"` (UTC).

| Input 1                          | Input 2                         | Output                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Time format (String)             | Time to convert (String)        | Time in RFC 3339 (String)  |

**Example:** This policy uses `time_parse()` to convert the value of the `thistime` annotation, expected to be in a different format, to RFC 3339 and rewriting that value.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: time
spec:
  rules:
  - name: set-time
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Service
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          annotations:
            thistime: "{{ time_parse('Mon Jan 02 2006 15:04:05 -0700','{{ @ }}') }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Time_since

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `time_since()` filter is used to calculate the difference between a start and end period of time where the end may either be a static definition or the then-current time. The time formats currently supported are [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) (the same as used by Kubernetes) or a user-definable time format as supported by the `time.Parse()` Go function as documented [here](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Parse). The output time difference is always given in hours, minutes, and seconds where seconds may either be an integer or floating point. For example, the expression `time_since('','2022-04-10T03:14:05-07:00','2022-04-11T03:14:05-07:00')` will result in the output of `"24h0m0s"`. The first input for time format defaults to RFC3339. The expression `time_since('Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 MST 2006', 'Mon Jan 02 15:04:05 MST 2021', 'Mon Jan 10 03:14:16 MST 2021')` uses Unix date format for the inputs (the same as when running the `date` program) and will result in the output `"180h10m11s"`. Helm time format is also parsable, for example `time_since('2006-Jan-02','2020-Jan-14','2020-Jan-17')` resulting in `"72h0m0s"`. And the expression `time_since('','2022-04-10T03:14:05-07:00','')` will result in the difference between the current time and the second input. The output will be given in which seconds is a floating point value, for example `"28h0m33.8257394s"`.

The time format (layout) parameter is optional and will be defaulted to RFC3339 if left empty (i.e., ''). It may not be set explicitly to an RFC3339 format. The time end (third input) may be set to an empty string indicating the current time (i.e., now) when the expression is evaluated.

| Input 1                          | Input 2                         | Input 3                       | Output                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Time format (String)             | Time start (String)             | Time end (String)             | Time difference (String)   |

**Example:** This policy uses `time_since()` to compare the time a container image was created to the present time, blocking if that difference is greater than six months.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: time-since-demo
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Audit
  rules:
    - name: block-stale-images
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
            - Pod
      validate:
        message: "Images built more than 6 months ago are prohibited."
        foreach:
        - list: "request.object.spec.containers"
          context:
          - name: imageData
            imageRegistry:
              reference: "{{ element.image }}"
          deny:
            conditions:
              all:
                - key: "{{ time_since('', '{{ imageData.configData.created }}', '') }}"
                  operator: GreaterThan
                  value: 4380h
```

</p>
</details>

### Time_to_cron

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `time_to_cron()` filter takes in a time in RFC 3339 format and outputs the equivalent Cron-style expression.

The expression `time_to_cron('2022-04-11T03:14:05-07:00')` results in the output `"14 3 11 4 1"`.

| Input 1                          | Output                     |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Time (string)                    | Cron expression (String)   |

**Example:** This policy uses the `time_to_cron()` filter in addition to `time_add()` and `time_now_utc()` to generate a ClusterCleanupPolicy from 4 hours after the triggering PolicyException is created, converting it into cron format for use by the ClusterCleanupPolicy.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: automate-cleanup
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: cleanup
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - PolicyException
          namespaces:
          - foo
    generate:
      apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2alpha1
      kind: ClusterCleanupPolicy
      name: polex-{{ request.namespace }}-{{ request.object.metadata.name }}-{{ random('[0-9a-z]{8}') }}
      synchronize: false
      data:
        metadata:
          labels:
            kyverno.io/automated: "true"
        spec:
          schedule: "{{ time_add('{{ time_now_utc() }}','4h') | time_to_cron(@) }}"
          match:
            any:
            - resources:
                kinds:
                  - PolicyException
                namespaces:
                - "{{ request.namespace }}"
                names:
                - "{{ request.object.metadata.name }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Time_truncate

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `time_truncate()` filter takes in a time in RFC 3339 format and a duration and outputs the nearest rounded down time that is a multiple of that duration.

The expression `time_truncate('2023-01-12T17:37:00Z','1h')` results in the output `"2023-01-12T17:00:00Z"`. The expression `time_truncate('2023-01-12T17:37:00Z','2h')` results in the output `"2023-01-12T16:00:00Z"`.

| Input 1                          | Input 2                         | Output                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Time in RFC 3339 (String)        | Duration (String)               | Time in RFC 3339 (String)  |

**Example:** This policy uses `time_truncate()` to get the current value of the `thistime` annotation and round it down to the nearest multiple of 2 hours which, when `thistime` is set to a value of `"2021-01-02T23:04:05Z"` should result in the Service being mutated with the value `"2021-01-02T22:00:00Z"`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: time
spec:
  rules:
  - name: set-time
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Service
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          annotations:
            thistime: "{{ time_truncate('{{ @ }}','2h') }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Time_utc

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `time_utc()` filter takes in a time in RFC 3339 format with a time offset and presents the same time in UTC/Zulu.

The expression `time_utc('2021-01-02T18:04:05-05:00')` results in the output `"2021-01-02T23:04:05Z"`. The expression `time_utc('2021-01-02T02:04:05+08:30')` results in the output `"2021-01-01T17:34:05Z"`.

| Input 1                          | Output                     |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Time in RFC 3339 (string)        | Time in RFC 3339 (String)  |

**Example:** This policy takes the time of the `thistime` annotation and rewrites it in UTC.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2beta1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: time
spec:
  rules:
  - name: set-time
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Service
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          annotations:
            thistime: "{{ time_utc('{{ @ }}') }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### To_boolean

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `to_boolean()` filter converts a string to its boolean equivalent. Any strings which spell out "true" or "false" regardless of character case will be returned in boolean format. For example, the query `to_boolean('true')` will result in the output `true`. The query `to_boolean('FalsE')` will result in the output `false`.

This filter can be helpful when needing to produce output for a field which only accepts boolean without requiring more complex string manipulation.

| Input 1            | Output  |
|--------------------|---------|
| String             | Boolean |

**Example:** This policy sets the `hostIPC` field of a Pod spec appropriately based on the value of a label (a string).

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: to-boolean-demo
spec:
  rules:
  - name: canuseIPC

### To_lower

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `to_lower()` filter takes in a string and outputs the same string with all lower-case letters. It is the opposite of [`to_upper()`](#to_upper).

| Input 1            | Output  |
|--------------------|---------|
| String             | String  |

**Example:** This policy sets the value of a label named `zonekey` to all caps.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: to-lower-demo
spec:
  rules:
  - name: format-deploy-zone
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Service
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            zonekey: "{{ to_lower('{{@}}') }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### To_upper

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `to_upper()` filter takes in a string and outputs the same string with all upper-case letters. It is the opposite of [`to_lower()`](#to_lower).

| Input 1            | Output  |
|--------------------|---------|
| String             | String  |

**Example:** This policy sets the value of a label named `deployzone` to all caps.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: to-upper-demo
spec:
  rules:
  - name: format-deploy-zone

          - Service
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            deployzone: "{{ to_upper('{{@}}') }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Trim

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `trim()` filter takes a string containing a "source" string, a second string representing a collection of discrete characters, and outputs the remainder of the source when both ends of the source string are trimmed by characters appearing in the collection. For example, inputs of `¡¡¡Hello, Gophers!!!` and `!¡` will result in the output `Hello, Gophers` since the characters `¡` and `!` are found at the beginning and end of the input string and will be trimmed. In the case of `trim('foocorpcom','mo')` the output returned is `foocorpc` since letters `m` and `o` are found at the end of `foocorpcom`. Notice that ordering of the letters in the second input is irrelevant. Interior characters will not be stripped unless exterior characters have also been removed. For example, `trim('foocorpcom','o')` will return the input of `foocorpcom` because `o` does not occur at the beginning or end of the input string. Characters named in the second input will be deduplicated from the source string so long as outside characters have been trimmed first. For example, `trim('foocorpcom','mcof')` will result in the output of `rp` since the other four characters in the second input collection can be stripped from the beginning and end of the input string.

This filter is similar to [`truncate()`](#truncate). The `trim()` filter can be useful to remove exact portions of a string when they are known literally.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output  |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| String             | String             | String  |

**Example:** This policy uses the `trim()` filter to remove the domain from an email value set in an annotation.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: trim-demo
spec:
  rules:
  - name: trim-extnameemail
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Service
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          annotations:
            extnameemail: "{{ trim('{{@}}','@corp.com') }}"
```

</p>
</details>

### Trim_prefix

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `trim_prefix()` filter takes an input string and from it trims the beginning by the second string. For the trim to occur, the input string must begin with the trimmed string. This filter differs from `trim()` in that it only removes a string from the beginning of another. For example, the query `trim_prefix('docker://kubevirt/fedora-cloud-registry-disk-demo','docker://')` will result in the output of `kubevirt/fedora-cloud-registry-disk-demo`.

The `trim_prefix()` filter can be useful to remove URIs found in container image values referenced by some custom resources, or anywhere else where a more strategic removal of a substring within a parent is required.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output  |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| String             | String             | String  |

**Example:** This policy uses the `trim_prefix()` filter to remove `docker://` from the name of an image in a KubeVirt `DataVolume` custom resource through use of an image extractor.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: verify-data-volume-image
spec:
  background: false
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
    - name: verify-data-volume-image
      match:
        any:
        - resources:
            kinds:
              - DataVolume
      imageExtractors:
        DataVolume:
          - path: /spec/source/registry/url
            jmesPath: "trim_prefix(@, 'docker://')"
      verifyImages:
      - imageReferences:
        - "*"
        mutateDigest: true
        verifyDigest: true
        attestors:
        - entries:
          - keys:
              publicKeys: |
                -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                ...
                -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

</p>
</details>

### Truncate

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `truncate()` filter takes a string, a number, and shortens (truncates) that string from the beginning to only include the desired number of characters. For example, calling `truncate()` on the string `foobar` by the number `3` would result in the output of `foo` because only three character positions were requested. This can be a useful filter when formulating values of names, labels, annotations, or other pieces of metadata to conform to a given length and to avoid overruns.

| Input 1            | Input 2            | Output  |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| String             | Number             | String  |

**Example:** This policy truncates the value of a label called `buildhash` to only take the first twelve characters.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: truncate-demo
spec:
  rules:
  - name: truncate-buildhash
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Namespace
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            buildhash: "{{ truncate('{{@}}',`12`) }}"
```

### x509_decode

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The `x509_decode()` filter takes in a string which is a PEM-encoded X509 certificate or certificate signing request (CSR), and outputs a JSON object with the decoded details. It may often be required to first decode a base64-encoded string using [base64_decode()](#base64_decode). This filter can be used to check and validate attributes within a certificate or a CSR such as subject, issuer, SAN fields, and expiration time. An example of a decoded certificate may look like the following:
