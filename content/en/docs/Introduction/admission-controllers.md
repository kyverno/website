## What are Admission Controllers?

In Kubernetes, Admission Controllers are responsible for intercepting requests coming to the API server after authenticating (e.g. using token or certificate), authorizing (e.g. using RBAC) the request and before persisting (saving) the request in the backend. They basically govern and enforce how the cluster is used.

For Example, whenever we create a new Pod, a request is sent to the Kubernetes API server and an Admission controller intercepts the request and it may validate, mutate or do both with the request.

## Admission Controllers Phases

Admission Controllers can be thought of as a gatekeeper to the API server. They intercept incoming API requests and may change the request object or deny the request altogether. This process of admission control has two phases: the mutating phase (where mutating admission controllers are run), followed by the validating phase (where validating admission controllers are run). Some of the admission controllers act as a combination of both. If any of the admission controllers reject the request, the entire request is rejected and an error is returned to the end-user.

For example, the LimitRanger admission controller can augment pods with default resource requests and limits (mutating phase) if the request doesn't specify it already, as well as it can verify that the pods with explicitly set resource requirements do not exceed the per-namespace limits specified in the LimitRange object (validating phase). Thus acting as a combination of both Mutating as well as Validating admission controller.

## Why do we need admission controllers?

Admission controllers were introduced in Kubernetes as a set of Plugins for improving the cluster security. Admission controllers must be enabled to use some of the more advanced security features of Kubernetes such as Pod security Policies.

Some aspects of the built-in Kubernetes’ operations are in fact governed by admission controllers. For example, when a namespace is deleted and subsequently enters the Terminating state, the NamespaceLifecycle admission controller is what prevents any new objects from being created in this namespace.

Following is the list of use cases of admission controllers:

- **Security:** Admission controllers can increase security by mandating a reasonable security baseline across an entire namespace or cluster. For Example, PodSecurityPolicy is a built-in admission controller that can be used for disallowing containers from running as root or making sure the container’s root filesystem is always mounted read-only (for example). Furthermore, you can use webhook-based admission controllers to achieve use cases like allowing pulling of images only from specific registries known to the enterprise. Or Rejecting deployments that do not meet security standards.

- **Governance:** Using Admission controllers you can enforce the adherence to certain practices like having good labels, annotations, resource limits, or other settings. For example, you can enforce label validation on different objects to ensure proper labels are being used, such as every object being assigned to a team or project, or every deployment specifying an app label. In another example, You can enforce annotations automatically being added to objects, such as attributing the correct cost center for a “dev” deployment resource.

- **Configuration management:** Admission controllers allow you to validate the configuration of the objects running in the cluster and prevent any obvious misconfigurations from hitting your cluster. Admission controllers can be useful in detecting and fixing images deployed without semantic tags, such as by automatically adding resource limits or validating resource limits, ensuring reasonable labels are added to pods, or ensuring image references used in production deployments are not using the latest tags, or tags with a -dev suffix.

In this way, admission controllers help in ensuring that applications stay in compliance within an ever-changing landscape of controls.

## Using Admission Controllers

Admission Controllers can be added by the administrator typically at the time of cluster creating by passing a flag to the `kube-apiserver`.

```sh
kube-apiserver --enable-admision-plugins=NamespaceLifecycle
```

Kubernetes recommends the following admission controllers to be enabled by default.

```sh
--enable-admission-plugins=NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,MutatingAdmissionWebhook,ValidatingAdmissionWebhook,Priority,ResourceQuota,PodSecurityPolicy
```

 You can find which admission plugins are enabled by:

```sh
kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins
```

disable-admission-plugins flag is used to disable a comma-delimited list of admission controllers. This list may also include admission controllers enabled by default.

```sh
kube-apiserver --disable-admission-plugins=PodNodeSelector,AlwaysDeny
```

## Admission Controllers (Kubernetes v1.28)

Following is a list of admission controllers enabled by default in the Kubernetes v1.28

| Admission Controllers | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NamespaceLifecycle | Enforces that no new objects can be created when a namespace is in the terminating state |
| LimitRanger | Using the "LimitRange" object type, you set the default and limit CPU/memory resources within a namespace. The LimitRanger admission controller will ensure these defaults and limits are applied |
| ServiceAccount | Implements the ServiceAccount feature |
| StorageObjectInUseProtection | The StorageObjectInUseProtection plugin adds the `kubernetes.io/pvc-protection` or `kubernetes.io/pv-protection` finalizers to newly created Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) or Persistent Volumes (PV). In case a user deletes a PVC or PV the PVC or PV is not removed until the finalizer is removed from the PVC or PV by PVC or PV Protection Controller. |
| DefaultIngressClass | This admission controller observes creation of Ingress objects that do not request any specific ingress class and automatically adds a default ingress class to them. |
| TaintNodesByCondition | This admission controller taints newly created Nodes as `NotReady` and `NoSchedule`. |
| DefaultStorageClass | If a Persistent VolumeClaim is created and it doesn't specify any specific storage, then this admission controller will add the default storage class to the PersistentVolumeClaim |
| DefaultTolerationSeconds | Sets a default toleration in seconds if not explicitly defined in the pod specification |
| NodeRestriction | Makes sure that kubelets (that run on every node) can only modify their own Node/Pod objects (objects that run on that specific node) |
| PodSecurity | The PodSecurity admission controller checks new Pods before they are admitted, determines if it should be admitted based on the requested security context and the restrictions on permitted Pod Security Standards for the namespace that the Pod would be in. |
| Priority | The priority admission controller uses the priorityClassName field and populates the integer value of the priority. If the priority class is not found, the Pod is rejected. |
| MutatingAdmissionWebhook | You can setup a webhook that can modify the object being sent to the kube-apiserver. The MutatingAdmissionWebhook ensures that matching objects will be sent to this webhook for modification |
| ValidatingAdmissionWebhook | You can setup a webhook that can validate the objects being sent to the kube-apiserver. If the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook rejects the request, the request fails |
| ValidatingAdmissionPolicy | This admission controller implements the CEL validation for incoming matched requests. It is enabled when both feature gate `validatingadmissionpolicy` and `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1` group/version are enabled. |
| ResourceQuota | Will check incoming requests to see if it doesn't violate constraints defined in the ResourceQuota object in a namespace |
| RuntimeClass | If you define a RuntimeClass with Pod overhead configured, this admission controller checks incoming Pods. When enabled, this admission controller rejects any Pod create requests that have the overhead already set. |
| CertificateApproval | This admission controller observes requests to approve CertificateSigningRequest resources and performs additional authorization checks to ensure the approving user has permission to approve certificate requests with the `spec.signerName` requested on the CertificateSigningRequest resource. |
| CertificateSigning | This admission controller observes updates to the status.certificate field of CertificateSigningRequest resources and performs an additional authorization checks to ensure the signing user has permission to sign certificate requests with the `spec.signerName` requested on the CertificateSigningRequest resource. |
| CertificateSubjectRestriction | This admission controller observes creation of CertificateSigningRequest resources that have a `spec.signerName` of `kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client`. It rejects any request that specifies a 'group' (or 'organization attribute') of `system:masters` |
| PersistentVolumeClaimResize | This admission controller implements additional validations for checking incoming `PersistentVolumeClaim` resize requests. |
