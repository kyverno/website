Kyverno offers multiple policy types decribed below.

Kyverno's mission is to be the best policy engine for Kubernetes, and allow aplying Kubernetes style policies everywhere. As Kubernetes has evolved, Kyverno is also evolving its APIs. The Kyverno [ValidatingPolicy](/docs/policy-types/validating-policy) and [ImageValidatingPolicy](/docs/policy-types/image-validating-policy) types were introduced in Release 1.14 (April 2025). Additional policy types will be introduced in subsequent releases.
