title: Generate Resources
description: Create additional resources based on resource creation, or label/metadata changes.

A ```generate``` rule can used to create additional resources when a new resource is created, or when labels or metadata is updated for a resource. This is useful to create supporting resources, such as new role bindings or network policies for a namespace.

The `generate` rule supports `match` and `exclude` blocks, like other rules. Hence, the trigger for applying this rule can be the creation of any resource and its possible to match or exclude API requests based on subjects, roles, etc.

The generate rule is triggered during a API CREATE operation. To keep resources synchronized across changes you can use the `synchronize` property. When `synchronize`  is set to `true`  the generated resource is kept in-sync with the source resource (which can be defined as part of the policy or may be an existing resource), and generated resources cannot be modified by users. If  `synchronize` is set to  `false` then users can update or delete the generated resource directly.

## Generate a ConfigMap using inline data

This policy sets the Zookeeper and Kafka connection strings for all namespaces.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: "zk-kafka-address"
spec:
  rules:
    - name: "zk-kafka-address"
      match:
        resources:
          kinds:
            - Namespace
      exclude:
        resources:
          namespaces:
            - "kube-system"
            - "default"
            - "kube-public"
            - "kyverno"
      generate:
        synchronize: true
        kind: ConfigMap
        name: zk-kafka-address
        # generate the resource in the new namespace
        namespace: "{{request.object.metadata.name}}"
        data:
          kind: ConfigMap
          data:
            ZK_ADDRESS: "192.168.10.10:2181,192.168.10.11:2181,192.168.10.12:2181"
            KAFKA_ADDRESS: "192.168.10.13:9092,192.168.10.14:9092,192.168.10.15:9092"
```

## Clone a ConfigMap and propagate changes

````yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: basic-policy
spec:
  rules:
    - name: "Clone ConfigMap"
      match:
        resources:
          kinds:
          - Namespace
      exclude:
        resources:
          namespaces:
            - "kube-system"
            - "default"
            - "kube-public"
            - "kyverno"
      generate:
        # Kind of generated resource
        kind: ConfigMap
        # Name of the generated resource
        name: default-config
        # namespace for the generated resource
        namespace: "{{request.object.metadata.name}}"
        # propagate changes from the upstream resource
        synchronize : true
        clone:
          namespace: default
          name: config-template
````

## Generate a NetworkPolicy

````yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: "default"
spec:
  rules:
  - name: "deny-all-traffic"
    match:
      resources:
        kinds:
        - Namespace
        name: "*"
    exclude:
      resources:
        namespaces:
          - "kube-system"
          - "default"
          - "kube-public"
          - "kyverno"
    generate:
      kind: NetworkPolicy
      name: deny-all-traffic
      namespace: "{{request.object.metadata.name}}"
      data:  
        spec:
          # select all pods in the namespace
          podSelector: {}
          policyTypes:
          - Ingress
          - Egress
````

In this example new namespaces will receive a `NetworkPolicy` that denies all inbound and outbound traffic.
