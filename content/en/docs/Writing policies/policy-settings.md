description: Common configuration for all rules in a policy.

A [policy](/docs/kyverno-policies/) contains one or more rules, and the following common settings which apply to all rules in the policy:

* **applyRules**: States how many of the rules in the parent policy should be applied to a matching resource. Values are `One` and `All` (default). If set to `One`, the first matching rule to be applied will stop further rules from being evaluated.

* **validationFailureAction**: controls if a validation policy rule failure should block the admission review request (`enforce`) or allow (`audit`) the admission review request and report the policy failure in a policy report. Defaults to `audit`.

* **validationFailureActionOverrides**: a ClusterPolicy attribute that specifies `validationFailureAction` Namespace-wise. It overrides `validationFailureAction` for the specified Namespaces.

* **background**: controls if rules are applied to existing resources during a background scan. Defaults to "true".

* **schemaValidation**: controls whether policy validation checks are applied. Defaults to "true". Kyverno will attempt to validate the schema of a policy and fail if it cannot determine it satisfies the OpenAPI schema definition for that resource. Can occur on either validate or mutate policies. Set to "false" to skip schema validation.

* **failurePolicy**: defines the API server behavior if the webhook fails to respond. Allowed values are "Ignore" or "Fail". Defaults to "Fail". Additionally, in 1.8.0, if set to "Ignore" will allow failing calls to image registries to be ignored. This allows for rule types like verifyImages or others which use image data to not block if the registry is temporarily down, useful in situations where images already exist on the nodes.

* **webhookTimeoutSeconds**: specifies the maximum time in seconds allowed to apply this policy. The default timeout is 10s. The value must be between 1 and 30 seconds.
