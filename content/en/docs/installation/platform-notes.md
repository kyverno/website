## Platform-Specific Notes

Depending on the application used to either install and manage Kyverno or the Kubernetes platform on which the cluster is built, there are some specific considerations of which to be aware. These notes are provided assuming the Helm chart is the installation artifact used.

### Notes for ArgoCD users

ArgoCD v2.10 introduced support for `ServerSideDiff`, leveraging Kubernetes' Server Side Apply feature to resolve OutOfSync issues. This strategy ensures comparisons are handled on the server side, respecting fields like `skipBackgroundRequests` that Kubernetes sets by default, and fields set by mutating admission controllers like Kyverno, thereby preventing unnecessary `OutOfSync` errors caused by local manifest discrepancies.

#### Configuration Best Practices

1. **Server-Side Configuration**
   - Enable `ServerSideDiff` in one of two ways:
     * Per Application: Add the `argocd.argoproj.io/compare-options` annotation
     * Globally: Configure it in the `argocd-cmd-params-cm` ConfigMap

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     annotations:
       argocd.argoproj.io/compare-options: ServerSideDiff=true,IncludeMutationWebhook=true 
       ...
   ```

2. **RBAC and CRD Management**
   - [Enable ServerSideApply](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-options/#server-side-apply) in the `syncOptions` to handle metadata properly
   - Configure ArgoCD to [ignore differences in aggregated ClusterRoles](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/diffing/#ignoring-rbac-changes-made-by-aggregateroles)
   - Ensure proper RBAC permissions for ArgoCD to manage Kyverno CRDs

3. **Sync Options Configuration**
   - Avoid using `Replace=true` as it may cause issues with existing resources
   - Use `ServerSideApply=true` for smooth resource updates
   - Enable `CreateNamespace=true` if deploying to a new namespace

#### Complete Application Example

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: kyverno
  namespace: argocd
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/compare-options: ServerSideDiff=true,IncludeMutationWebhook=true
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: kyverno
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  project: default
  source:
    chart: kyverno
    repoURL: https://kyverno.github.io/kyverno
    targetRevision: <my.target.version>
    helm:
      values: |
        webhookLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: argocd
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
      - ServerSideApply=true
```

#### Troubleshooting Guide

1. **CRD Check Failures**
   - **Symptom**: Deployment fails during CRD validation
   - **Common Causes**:
     * Insufficient RBAC permissions
     * CRDs not properly registered
   - **Resolution**:
     * Verify RBAC permissions for ArgoCD service account
     * Ensure CRDs are installed before policies
     * Check ArgoCD logs for specific permission errors

2. **Sync Failures**
   - **Symptom**: Resources show as OutOfSync
   - **Common Causes**:
     * Missing ServerSideDiff configuration
     * Aggregated ClusterRole differences
   - **Resolution**:
     * Enable ServerSideDiff as shown above
     * Configure resource exclusions for aggregated roles
     * Check resource health status in ArgoCD UI

3. **Resource Management Issues**
   - **Symptom**: Resources not properly created or updated
   - **Common Causes**:
     * Incorrect sync options
     * Resource ownership conflicts
   - **Resolution**:
     * Use ServerSideApply instead of Replace
     * Configure resource tracking method
     * Verify resource ownership labels

4. **Performance and Scaling**
   - **Symptom**: Slow syncs or resource processing
   - **Common Causes**:
     * Large number of resources
     * Resource intensive operations
   - **Resolution**:
     * Use selective sync for large deployments
     * Configure appropriate resource limits
     * Enable background processing where applicable

For considerations when using Argo CD along with Kyverno mutate policies, see the documentation [here](/docs/policy-types/cluster-policy/mutate.md#argocd).

#### Resource Tracking and Ownership

ArgoCD automatically sets the `app.kubernetes.io/instance` label and uses it to determine which resources form the app. The Kyverno Helm chart also sets this label for the same purposes. To resolve this conflict:

1. Configure ArgoCD to use a different tracking mechanism as described in the [documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/#additional-tracking-methods-via-an-annotation).
2. Add appropriate annotations to your Application manifest.

Argo CD users may also have Kyverno add labels to webhooks via the `webhookLabels` key in the [Kyverno ConfigMap](customization.md#configmap-keys), helpful when viewing the Kyverno application in Argo CD.

### Notes for OpenShift Users

Red Hat OpenShift contains a feature called [Security Context Constraints](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html) (SCC) which enforces certain security controls in a profile-driven manner. An OpenShift cluster contains several of these out of the box with OpenShift 4.11 preferring `restricted-v2` by default. The Kyverno Helm chart defines its own values for the Pod's `securityContext` object which, although it conforms to the upstream [Pod Security Standards' restricted profile](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted), may potentially be incompatible with your defined Security Context Constraints. Deploying the Kyverno Helm chart as-is on an OpenShift environment may result in an error similar to "unable to validate against any security context constraint". In order to get past this, deploy the Kyverno Helm chart with with the required securityContext flags/fields set to a value of `null`. OpenShift will apply the defined SCC upon deployment. If on OpenShift 4.11+, the `restricted-v2` profile is known to allow for successful deployment of the chart without modifying the Helm chart installation process.

### Notes for EKS Users

For EKS clusters built with the VPC CNI plug-in, if you wish to opt for the operability strategy as defined in the [Security vs Operability section](_index.md#security-vs-operability), during the installation of Kyverno you should exclude the `kube-system` Namespace from webhooks as this is the Namespace where the plug-in runs. In situations where all the cluster Nodes are "deleted" (ex., only one node group in the cluster which is scaled to zero), which also impacts where the Kyverno replicas run, if `kube-system` is not excluded and where at least one policy in `Fail` mode matches on Pods, the VPC CNI plug-in's DaemonSet Pods may not be able to come online to finish the Node bootstrapping process. If this situation occurs, because the underlying cluster network cannot return to a healthy state, Kyverno will be unable to service webhook requests. As of Kyverno 1.12, `kube-system` is excluded by default in webhooks.

### Notes for AKS Users

AKS uses an Admission Enforcer control the webhooks in an AKS cluster and will remove those that may impact system Namespaces. Since Kyverno registers as a webhook, this Admission Enforcer may remove Kyverno's webhook causing the two to fight over webhook reconciliation. See [this Microsoft Azure FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/faq#can-admission-controller-webhooks-impact-kube-system-and-internal-aks-namespaces) for further information. When deploying Kyverno on an AKS cluster, set the Helm option `config.webhookAnnotations` to include the necessary annotation to disable the Admission Enforcer. Kyverno will configure its webhooks with this annotation to prevent their removal by AKS. The annotation that should be used is `"admissions.enforcer/disabled": true`. See the chart [README](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/blob/release-1.12/charts/kyverno/README.md) for more information. As of Kyverno 1.12, this annotation has already been set for you.
