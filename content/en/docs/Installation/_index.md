  Installation and configuration details for Kyverno using `Helm` or `kubectl`.
---

Kyverno can be installed using Helm or deploying from the YAML manifests directly. When using either of these methods, there are no other steps required to get Kyverno up and running.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
As of v1.4.0, Kyverno supports multiple replicas for increased scale and availability. The minimum recommended number is 3.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Kyverno Version                | Kubernetes Min | Kubernetes Max |
|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1.4.x                          | 1.16           | 1.21           |
| 1.5.x                          | 1.16           | 1.21           |
| 1.6.x                          | 1.16           | 1.23.3         |

\* Due to a known issue with Kubernetes 1.23.0-1.23.2, support for 1.23 begins at 1.23.3.

## Install Kyverno using Helm

Kyverno can be deployed through a Helm chart which is accessible either through the Kyverno repo or on [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/kyverno/kyverno).

In order to install Kyverno with Helm, first add the Kyverno Helm repository.

```sh
helm repo add kyverno https://kyverno.github.io/kyverno/
```

Scan the new repository for charts.

```sh
helm repo update
```

Use Helm 3.2+ to create a Namespace and install Kyverno.

```sh
helm install kyverno kyverno/kyverno --namespace kyverno --create-namespace
```

Beginning with Kyverno 1.5.0, Kyverno Helm chart v2.1.0, the Kyverno [Pod Security Standard policies](/policies/pod-security/) must be added separately and after Kyverno is installed.

```sh
helm install kyverno-policies kyverno/kyverno-policies --namespace kyverno
```

To install pre-releases, add the `--devel` switch to Helm.

```sh
helm install kyverno kyverno/kyverno --namespace kyverno --create-namespace --devel
helm install kyverno-policies kyverno/kyverno-policies --namespace kyverno --devel
```

For Helm versions prior to 3.2, create a Namespace and then install the Kyverno Helm chart.

```sh
kubectl create namespace kyverno
helm install kyverno kyverno/kyverno --namespace kyverno
helm install kyverno-policies kyverno/kyverno-policies --namespace kyverno
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
For all of the flags available during a Helm installation of Kyverno, see [here](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/tree/main/charts/kyverno).
{{% /alert %}}

## Install Kyverno using YAMLs

If you'd rather deploy the manifest directly, simply apply the release file.

This manifest path will always point to the latest main branch.

```sh
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyverno/kyverno/main/config/install.yaml
```

You can also pull from a release branch to install the stable releases including release candidates.

```sh
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyverno/kyverno/release-1.6/config/release/install.yaml
```

## Customize the installation of Kyverno

The picture below shows shows a typical Kyverno installation:

<img src="/images/kyverno-installation.png" alt="Kyverno Installation" width="80%"/>
<br/><br/>

If you wish to customize the installation of Kyverno to have certificates signed by an internal or trusted CA, or to otherwise learn how the components work together, follow the below guide.

### Installing a specific version

To install a specific version, download `install.yaml` and then change the image tag.

e.g., change image tag from `latest` to the specific tag `v1.3.0`.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: kyverno
      # image: ghcr.io/kyverno/kyverno:latest
      image: ghcr.io/kyverno/kyverno:v1.3.0
```

To install in a specific namespace replace the namespace "kyverno" with your namespace.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: <namespace>
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: kyverno
  name: kyverno-svc
  namespace: <namespace>
```

and in other places (ServiceAccount, ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings, ConfigMaps, Service, Deployment) where Namespace is mentioned.

Alternatively, use [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) to replace the Namespace.

To run Kyverno:

```sh
kubectl create -f ./install.yaml
```

To check the Kyverno controller status, run the command:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
```

If the Kyverno controller is not running, you can check its status and logs for errors:

```sh
kubectl describe pod <kyverno-pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

```sh
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kyverno -n <namespace>
```

### Certificate Management

The Kyverno policy engine runs as an admission webhook and requires a CA-signed certificate and key to setup secure TLS communication with the kube-apiserver (the CA can be self-signed). There are two ways to configure secure communications between Kyverno and the kube-apiserver.

#### Option 1: Auto-generate a self-signed CA and certificate

Kyverno can automatically generate a new self-signed Certificate Authority (CA) and a CA signed certificate to use for webhook registration. This is the default behavior when installing Kyverno.

```sh
## Install Kyverno
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyverno/kyverno/main/config/release/install.yaml
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
The above command installs the last released version of Kyverno, which may not be stable. If you want to install a different version, you can edit the `install.yaml` file and update the image tag.
{{% /alert %}}

Also, by default Kyverno is installed in the `kyverno` Namespace. To install it in a different namespace, you can edit `install.yaml` and update the Namespace.

To check the Kyverno controller status, run the command:

```sh
## Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
```

If the Kyverno controller is not running, you can check its status and logs for errors:

```sh
kubectl describe pod <kyverno-pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

```sh
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kyverno -n <namespace>
```

#### Option 2: Use your own CA-signed certificate

You can install your own CA-signed certificate, or generate a self-signed CA and use it to sign a certificate. Once you have a CA and X.509 certificate-key pair, you can install these as Kubernetes Secrets in your cluster. If Kyverno finds these Secrets, it uses them. Otherwise it will create its own CA and sign a certificate from it (see Option 1 above).

##### 2.1. Generate a self-signed CA and signed certificate-key pair

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}}
Using a separate self-signed root CA is difficult to manage and not recommended for production use.
{{% /alert %}}

If you already have a CA and a signed certificate, you can directly proceed to Step 2.

Below is a process which shows how to create a self-signed root CA, and generate a signed certificate and key using [step CLI](https://smallstep.com/cli/):

1. Create a self-signed CA

```sh
step certificate create kyverno-ca rootCA.crt rootCA.key --profile root-ca --insecure --no-password
```

2. Generate a leaf certificate with a five-year expiration

```sh
step certificate create kyverno-svc tls.crt tls.key --profile leaf \
            --ca rootCA.crt --ca-key rootCA.key \
            --san kyverno-svc --san kyverno-svc.kyverno --san kyverno-svc.kyverno.svc --not-after 43200h --insecure --no-password
```

3. Verify the contents of the certificate

```sh
step certificate inspect tls.crt --short
```

The certificate must contain the SAN information in the `X509v3 extensions` section:

```sh
X509v3 extensions:
    X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
        DNS:kyverno-svc, DNS:kyverno-svc.kyverno, DNS:kyverno-svc.kyverno.svc
```

##### 2.2. Configure Secrets for the CA and TLS certificate-key pair

You can now use the following files to create Secrets:

- `rootCA.crt`
- `tls.crt`
- `tls.key`

To create the required Secrets, use the following commands (do not change the Secret names):

```sh
kubectl create ns <namespace>
kubectl create secret tls kyverno-svc.kyverno.svc.kyverno-tls-pair --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key -n <namespace>
kubectl annotate secret kyverno-svc.kyverno.svc.kyverno-tls-pair self-signed-cert=true -n <namespace>
kubectl create secret generic kyverno-svc.kyverno.svc.kyverno-tls-ca --from-file=rootCA.crt -n <namespace>
kubectl annotate secret kyverno-svc.kyverno.svc.kyverno-tls-ca self-signed-cert=true -n <namespace>
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
The annotation on the TLS pair secret is used by Kyverno to identify the use of self-signed certificates and checks for the required root CA secret.
{{% /alert %}}

Secret | Data | Content
------------ | ------------- | -------------
`kyverno-svc.kyverno.svc.kyverno-tls-pair` | tls.key & tls.crt  | key and signed certificate
`kyverno-svc.kyverno.svc.kyverno-tls-ca` | rootCA.crt | root CA used to sign the certificate

Kyverno uses Secrets created above to setup TLS communication with the kube-apiserver and specify the CA bundle to be used to validate the webhook server's certificate in the admission webhook configurations.

This process has been automated for you with a simple script that generates a self-signed CA, a TLS certificate-key pair, and the corresponding Kubernetes secrets: [helper script](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/blob/main/scripts/generate-self-signed-cert-and-k8secrets.sh)

##### 2.3. Install Kyverno

You can now install Kyverno by selecting one of the available methods from the [installation section above](/docs/installation/#compatibility-matrix).

### Roles and Permissions

Kyverno creates several Roles and RoleBindings, some of which need to be customized to allow access to sensitive cluster-wide resources.

#### Roles

Kyverno requires the following permissions:

* create and update select resources in its namespace (e.g. `Lease` used for leader elections) and some cluster-wide resources (e.g. `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` used for registering and managing webhooks).
* create, update, delete, get, list, and watch Kyverno custom resources such as `ClusterPolicy`.
* view, list, and watch resources to apply validation policy rules during background scans.
* create, update, delete, get, list, and watch resources managed via [generate policy](/docs/writing-policies/generate/) rules.

Kyverno creates the following roles that are bound to the `kyverno-service-account`

{{% alert title="Tip" color="info" %}}
Use `kubectl get clusterroles,roles -A | grep kyverno` to view all Kyverno roles.
{{% /alert %}}

**Cluster Roles**

The following `ClusterRoles` provide Kyverno with permissions to policies and other Kubernetes resources across all Namespaces:

- `kyverno:policies`: manages policies, reports, generate requests, report change requests, and status
- `kyverno:view`: views all resources
- `kyverno:generate`: creates, updates, and deletes resources via generate policy rules
- `kyverno:events`: creates, updates, and deletes events for policy results
- `kyverno:userinfo`: query Roles and RoleBinding configurations to build [variables](/docs/writing-policies/variables/#pre-defined-variables) with Role information.
- `kyverno:webhook`: allows Kyverno to manage dynamic webhook configurations

For each `ClusterRole` a `ClusterRoleBinding` with the same name as the `ClusterRole` is used to bind the permissions to the `kyverno-service-account`.

**Namespaced Roles**

The following `Roles` provide Kyverno with permissions to manage select resources in the Kyverno Namespace:

- `kyverno:leaderelection`: manage leases for leader election across replicas

For each `Role` a `RoleBinding` with the same name as the `Role` is used to bind the permissions to the `kyverno-service-account`.

**Role aggregators**

The following `ClusterRoles` are used to extend the default `admin` role with permissions to view and manage policy resources via [role aggregation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#aggregated-clusterroles):

- `kyverno:admin-policies`: allow `admin` role to manage Policies and ClusterPolicies
- `kyverno:admin-policyreport`: allow `admin` role to manage PolicyReports and ClusterPolicyReports
- `kyverno:admin-reportchangerequest`: allow `admin` role to manage ClusterReportChangeRequests and ClusterReportChangeRequests

#### Customizing Permissions

The default `kyverno:view` and `kyverno:generate` can be customized.

For example, if a CustomResource is added to the cluster the configured Roles can be extended to allow Kyverno permissions to generate and/or mutate the new resource type. Or, new ClusterRole/Role and ClusterRoleBinding/RoleBinding pairs can be created and mapped to the Kyverno ServiceAccount.

This sample configuration provides Kyverno additional permissions to generate `clusterroles` and `clusterrolebindings`:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: kyverno:generate-roles
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - "*"
  resources:
  - clusterroles
  - clusterrolebindings
  verbs:
  - create
  - update
  - delete
  - list
  - get
---
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: kyverno:generate-roles
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: kyverno:generate-roles
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: kyverno-service-account
```

### ConfigMap Flags

The following flags are used to control the behavior of Kyverno and must be set in the Kyverno ConfigMap.

1. `excludeGroupRole`: excludeGroupRole role expected string with comma-separated group role. It will exclude all the group role from the user request. Default we are using `system:serviceaccounts:kube-system,system:nodes,system:kube-scheduler`.
2. `excludeUsername`: excludeUsername expected string with comma-separated kubernetes username. In generate request if user enable `Synchronize` in generate policy then only kyverno can update/delete generated resource but admin can exclude specific username who have access of delete/update generated resource.
3. `resourceFilters`: Kubernetes resources in the format "[kind,namespace,name]" where the policy is not evaluated by the admission webhook. For example --filterKind "[Deployment, kyverno, kyverno]" --filterKind "[Deployment, kyverno, kyverno],[Events, *, *]".
4. `generateSuccessEvents`: specifies whether (true/false) to generate success events. Default is set to "false".

### Container Flags

The following flags can also be used to control the advanced behavior of Kyverno and must be set on the main `kyverno` container in the form of arguments.

1. `-v`: Sets the verbosity mode of Kyverno log output. Takes an integer from 1 to 6 with 6 being the most verbose. Level 4 shows variable substitution messages.
2. `profile`: setting this flag to 'true' will enable profiling.
3. `profilePort`: specifies port to enable profiling at, defaults to 6060.
4. `metricsPort`: specifies the port to expose prometheus metrics, default to port 8000.
5. `genWorkers`: the number of workers for processing generate policies concurrently. Default is set to 10.
6. `disableMetrics`: specifies whether (true/false) to enable exposing the metrics. Default is set to 'false'.
7. `backgroundScan`: the interval (like 30s, 15m, 12h) for background processing. Default is set to 1h.
8. `imagePullSecrets`: specifies secret resource names for image registry access credentials.
9. `autoUpdateWebhooks`: Set this flag to 'false' to disable auto-configuration of the webhook. Default is set to 'true'.
10. `imageSignatureRepository`: specifies alternate repository for image signatures. Can be overridden per rule via `verifyImages.Repository`.
11. `webhookRegistrationTimeout`: specifies the length of time Kyverno will try to register webhooks with the API server. Defaults to `120s`.

### Policy Report access

During the Kyverno installation, it creates a ClusterRole `kyverno:admin-policyreport` which has permission to perform all operations on resources `policyreport` and `clusterpolicyreport`. To grant access to a Namespace admin, configure the following YAML file then apply to the cluster.

- Replace `metadata.namespace` with Namespace of the admin
- Configure `subjects` field to bind admin's role to the ClusterRole `policyviolation`

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: policyviolation
  # change namespace below to create rolebinding for the namespace admin
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: kyverno:admin-policyreport
subjects:
# configure below to access policy violation for the namespace admin
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: default
# - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
#   kind: User
#   name:
# - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
#   kind: Group
#   name:
```

### Webhooks

Starting with Kyverno 1.5.0, the `mutatingWebhookConfiguration` and the `validatingWebhookConfiguration` resources are registered and managed dynamically based on the configured policies. Prior to 1.5.0, Kyverno uses a wildcard webhook that allowed it to receive admission requests for all resources. With the webhook auto-configuration feature, Kyverno now only receives admission requests for select resources, hence preventing unnecessary admission requests being forwarded to Kyverno.

Additionally, the `failurePolicy` and `webhookTimeoutSeconds` [policy configuration options](/docs/writing-policies/policy-settings/) allow granular control of webhook settings. By default, policies will be configured to "fail-closed" (i.e. the admission request will fail if the webhook invocation has an unexpected error or a timeout) unless the `failurePolicy` is set to `Ignore`.

This feature is enabled by default in 1.5.0+ but can be turned off by the flag `--autoUpdateWebhooks=false`. If disabled, Kyverno creates the default webhook configurations that forwards admission requests for all resources and with `FailurePolicy` set to `Ignore`.

The `spec.failurePolicy` and `spec.webhookTimeoutSeconds` and [policy configuration fields](/docs/writing-policies/policy-settings/) allow per-policy settings which are automatically aggregated and used to register the required set of webhook configurations.

Prior to 1.5.0, by default, the Kyverno webhook will process all API server requests for all Namespaces and the policy application was filtered using Resource Filters and Namespace Selectors discussed below.

### Resource Filters

**NOTE:** In 1.5.0+ resource filters are only used when the `autoUpdateWebhooks` flag is set to `false`.

The Kubernetes kinds that should be ignored by policies can be filtered by adding a ConfigMap in Namespace `kyverno` and specifying the resources to be filtered under `data.resourceFilters`. The default name of this ConfigMap is `kyverno` but can be changed by modifying the value of the environment variable `INIT_CONFIG` in the Kyverno deployment spec. `data.resourceFilters` must be a sequence of one or more `[<Kind>,<Namespace>,<Name>]` entries with `*` as a wildcard. Thus, an item `[Node,*,*]` means that admissions of kind `Node` in any namespace and with any name will be ignored. Wildcards are also supported in each of these sequences. For example, this sequence filters out kind `Pod` in namespace `foo-system` having names beginning with `redis`.

```
[Pod,foo-system,redis*]
```

By default a number of kinds are skipped in the default configuration including Nodes, Events, APIService, SubjectAccessReview, and more.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kyverno
  namespace: kyverno
data:
  # resource types to be skipped by kyverno policy engine
  resourceFilters: '[Event,*,*][*,kube-system,*][*,kube-public,*][*,kube-node-lease,*][Node,*,*][APIService,*,*][TokenReview,*,*][SubjectAccessReview,*,*][SelfSubjectAccessReview,*,*][*,kyverno,*][Binding,*,*][ReplicaSet,*,*][ReportChangeRequest,*,*][ClusterReportChangeRequest,*,*]'
```

To modify the ConfigMap, either directly edit the ConfigMap `kyverno` in the default configuration inside `install.yaml` and redeploy it or modify the ConfigMap using `kubectl`.  Changes to the ConfigMap through `kubectl` will automatically be picked up at runtime.

### Namespace Selectors

**NOTE:** In 1.5.0+ namespace selectors are only used when the `autoUpdateWebhooks` flag is set to `false`.

In some cases, it is desired to limit those to certain Namespaces based upon labels. Kyverno can filter on these Namespaces using a `namespaceSelector` object by adding a new `webhooks` object to the ConfigMap. For example, in the below snippet, the `webhooks` object has been added with a `namespaceSelector` object which will filter on Namespaces with the label `environment=prod`. The `webhooks` key only accepts as its value a JSON-formatted `namespaceSelector` object.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  resourceFilters: '[Event,*,*][*,kube-system,*][*,kube-public,*][*,kube-node-lease,*][Node,*,*][APIService,*,*][TokenReview,*,*][SubjectAccessReview,*,*][SelfSubjectAccessReview,*,*][*,kyverno,*][Binding,*,*][ReplicaSet,*,*][ReportChangeRequest,*,*][ClusterReportChangeRequest,*,*]'
  webhooks: '[{"namespaceSelector":{"matchExpressions":[{"key":"environment","operator":"In","values":["prod"]}]}}]'
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kyverno
  namespace: kyverno
```

## Upgrading Kyverno

Upgrading Kyverno is as simple as applying the new YAML manifest, or using Helm depending on how it was installed.

### Upgrade Kyverno with YAML manifest

Apply the new manifest over the existing installation.

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyverno/kyverno/main/config/install.yaml
```

### Upgrade Kyverno with Helm

Kyverno can be upgraded like any other Helm chart.

Scan your Helm repositories for updated charts.

```sh
helm repo update
```

Show the versions of the Kyverno chart which are available. To see pre-release charts, add the `--devel` flag to the `helm` command.

```sh
helm search repo kyverno
```

Run the upgrade command picking the target version.

```sh
helm upgrade kyverno kyverno/kyverno --namespace kyverno --version <version_number>
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}}
Upgrading to Kyverno 1.5.0+ (Helm chart v2.1.0) from a version between 1.4.2 to 1.4.3 (Helm chart `>=v2.0.2 <v2.1.0`) will require extra steps.
The step to remove CRDs will cause all Kyverno policies to get removed, so a backup must be taken of policies not added by Helm.
{{% /alert %}}

Below are the steps to upgrade Kyverno to 1.5.0 from 1.4.3. The upgrade to 1.5.0+ requires first removing the old CRDs chart.

First take a backup of all cluster policies not added by Helm:

```sh
kubectl get clusterpolicy -l app.kubernetes.io/managed-by!=Helm -A -o yaml > kyverno-policies.yaml
```

Perform the upgrade

```sh
helm uninstall kyverno --namespace kyverno
helm uninstall kyverno-crds --namespace kyverno
helm install kyverno kyverno/kyverno --namespace kyverno --version <version_number>
```

Restore Kyverno cluster policies

```sh
kubectl apply -f kyverno-policies.yaml
```

## Uninstalling Kyverno

To uninstall Kyverno, use either the raw YAML manifest or Helm. The Kyverno deployment, RBAC resources, and all CRDs will be removed, including any reports.

### Option 1 - Uninstall Kyverno with YAML manifest

```sh
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyverno/kyverno/main/config/install.yaml
```

### Option 2 - Uninstall Kyverno with Helm

```sh
helm uninstall kyverno kyverno/kyverno --namespace kyverno
```

### Clean up Webhook Configurations

Kyverno by default will try to clean up all its webhook configurations when terminated. But in cases where its RBAC resources are removed first, it will lose the permission to do so properly.

Regardless which uninstallation method is chosen, webhooks will need to be manually removed as the final step. Use the below commands to delete those webhook configurations.

```sh
kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations kyverno-policy-mutating-webhook-cfg kyverno-resource-mutating-webhook-cfg kyverno-verify-mutating-webhook-cfg

kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations kyverno-policy-validating-webhook-cfg kyverno-resource-validating-webhook-cfg
```
