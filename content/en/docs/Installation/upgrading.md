## Upgrading Kyverno

Kyverno supports the same upgrade methods as those supported for installation. The below sections will cover both Helm and YAML manifest. Because new versions of Kyverno often have a number of supporting resources which change, including CRDs, an upgrade cannot be done by bumping the tag of any image.

Kyverno 1.10 brought breaking changes making upgrades to it or versions after 1.10 limited in nature. Always read the complete [release notes](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/releases) for any version prior to upgrading. If skipping a minor version, be sure to read the release notes for each minor version in between.

### Upgrade Kyverno with YAML

Direct upgrades from previous versions are not supported when using the YAML manifest approach. Please use the corresponding release manifest from the tagged release used to install to perform the uninstallation. Once Kyverno is removed, follow the [installation instructions](/docs/installation/methods/#install-kyverno-using-yamls) to install Kyverno.

### Upgrade Kyverno with Helm

An upgrade from versions prior to Kyverno 1.10 to versions at 1.10 or higher using Helm requires manual intervention and cannot be performed via a direct upgrade process. Please see the 1.10 migration guide [here](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/blob/release-1.10/charts/kyverno/README.md#migrating-from-v2-to-v3) for more complete information.
