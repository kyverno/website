## Join Kyverno Adopters

Kyverno is a CNCF incubating project and is growing fast. To qualify for the [graduation level](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md#graduation-stage) the CNCF requires production usage by multiple end users.

The goal of this adopters program is to gather real-world usage examples and help the Kyverno project grow. We hope to achieve this by learning from the existing and new adopters of Kyverno who are willing to share their stories with CNCF.

To participate, fill out the [Kyverno adopters form](https://forms.gle/K5CApcBAD5D4H1AG8).

#### Maintainers

Maintainers are individuals who go beyond the status of code owner who have shown good technical judgement in feature design/development in the past. Maintainers have overall knowledge of the project and features in the project. They can read, clone, and push to the repository. They can also manage issues, pull requests, and some repository settings.

[Maintainers](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization#repository-access-for-each-permission-level) are the technical authority for a subproject and are considered leaders for the organization as a whole. They must have demonstrated both good judgement and responsibility towards the health of the subproject. Maintainers must set technical direction and make or approve design decisions for their subproject, either directly or through delegation of these responsibilities. Unlike contributors and code owners, maintainers have the highest degree of responsibility and ownership for the project. Maintainer status may be subject to a vote and, if the minimum level of activity is not maintained, may be moved to an _emeritus_ status.

#### Mapping Project Roles to GitHub Roles

The roles used in this document are custom roles mapped according to the [GitHub roles and responsibilities](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization).

| Project Role   | GitHub Role    |
| -------------- | -------------- |
