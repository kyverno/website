## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome all types of contributions and encourage you to read our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for next steps.

The project contributors use a combination of [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/discussions), [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/wiki) for design documents, and the [#kyverno-dev Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C032MM2CH7X) for notes on the development environment, project guidelines, and best practices.

## Join Kyverno Adopters

Kyverno is a CNCF sandbox project is growing fast. To qualify for the [incubation level](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md) the CNCF requires production usage by multiple end users.

The goal of this adopters program is to gather real-world usage examples and help Kyverno achieve the incubating state criteria. We hope to achieve this by learning from the existing and new adopters of Kyverno who are willing to share their stories with CNCF. The adopters can remain private or choose to be listed in the public [Adopters List](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md).

To participate, fill out the [ Kyverno adopters form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMJxbK6eQ-MpsbaXZ3GKp8NEz9F932keL2pwznI1JIfi7Iqw/viewform).
