Microservices enhance the productivity of individual development teams by dividing applications into smaller, independent components. However, microservices alone do not address longstanding challenges in distributed systems such as authentication and authorization. These problems can become even harder to manage due to the diverse and short-lived nature of the microservice environments.

As more organizations move to using microservices, there is an increasing need for separate authentication and authorization mechanisms that work across different microservices.

In this blog post, we will introduce [Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno-envoy-plugin), how it works and how you can use this version of Kyverno to enforce fine-grained, context-aware access control policies with Envoy without modifying your microservice or application code.

## What is Envoy

[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/what_is_envoy) is a Layer 7 proxy and communication bus tailored for large-scale, modern service-oriented architectures. Starting from version 1.7.0, Envoy includes an [External Authorization filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/security/ext_authz_filter.html) that interfaces with an authorization service to check if the incoming request is authorized or not. This functionality allows authorization decisions to be offloaded to an external service, which can access the request context. The request context includes details such as the origin and destination of the network activity, as well as specifics of the network request (e.g., HTTP request). This information enables the external service to make a well-informed decision regarding the authorization of the incoming request processed by Envoy.

## What is Kyverno-Envoy Plugin

[Kyverno-Envoy](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno-envoy-plugin) plugin extends [Kyverno-JSON](https://kyverno.github.io/kyverno-json/latest/) with a gRPC server that implements [Envoy External Authorization API](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/security/ext_authz_filter.html). This allows you to enforce Kyverno policies on incoming and outgoing traffic in a service mesh environment, providing an additional layer of security and control over your applications. You can use this version of Kyverno to enforce fine-grained, context-aware access control policies with Envoy without modifying your microservice.

## How does this work

In addition to the Envoy sidecar, your application pods will include a Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin component, either as a sidecar or as a separate pod. This Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin will be configured to communicate with the Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin gRPC server. When Envoy receives an API request intended for your microservice, it consults the Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin server to determine whether the request should be permitted.

Here is the architecture when Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin deployed as a sidecar to your application:

Here is the architecture when Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin deployed as a separate pod to your application:

![architecture-pod](./arch-seprate-pod.png)

Performing policy evaluations locally with Envoy is advantageous, as it eliminates the need for an additional network hop for authorization checks, thus enhancing both performance and availability.

The Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin can be deployed with Envoy-based sevice meshes such as [Istio](https://istio.io/), [Gloo](https://gloo.solo.io/), [Kuma](https://kuma.io/) etc.

## Getting started

In this blog, we will deploy the Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin as a sidecar container next to the application container. The plugin will handle authorizing incoming requests to the application. Additionally, [documentation](https://kyverno.github.io/kyverno-envoy-plugin/dev/) is provided for deploying the plugin as a separate pod.

Before we can look at Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin we need a Kubernetes cluster. We can create a local cluster with [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

### Create a local cluster

Start minikube cluster with the following command:

```sh
minikube start
```

### Install Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin sidecar with application

Install application with Envoy and Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin as a sidecar container.

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyverno/kyverno-envoy-plugin/main/quick_start.yaml 
```

The `applicaition.yaml` manifest defines the following resource:

- The Deployment includes an example Go application that provides information of books in the library books collection and exposes APIs to `get`, `create` and `delete` books collection. Check this out for more information about the [Go test application](https://github.com/Sanskarzz/kyverno-envoy-demos/tree/main/test-application) . 

- The Deployment also includes a Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin sidecar container in addition to the Envoy sidecar container. When Envoy recevies API request destined for the Go test applicaiton, it will check with Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin to decide if the request should be allowed and the Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin sidecar container is configured to query Kyverno-JSON engine for policy decisions on incoming requests.

- A ConfigMap `policy-config` is used to pass the policy to Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin sidecar in the namespace `default` where the application is deployed .

- A ConfigMap `envoy-config` is used to pass an Envoy configuration with an External Authorization Filter to direct authorization checks to the Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin sidecar. 

- The Deployment also includes an init container that install iptables rules to redirect all container traffic to the Envoy proxy sidecar container , more about init container can be found [here](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno-envoy-plugin/tree/main/demo/standalone-envoy/envoy_iptables)

### Make Test application accessible in the cluster

```console 
kubectl expose deployment testapp --type=NodePort --name=testapp --port=8080
```
 
### Set the `SERVICE_URL` environment variable to the service's IP/port

minikube:

```sh
export SERVICE_PORT=$(kubectl get service testapp -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.port==8080)].nodePort}')
export SERVICE_HOST=$(minikube ip)
export SERVICE_URL=$SERVICE_HOST:$SERVICE_PORT
echo $SERVICE_URL
```

### Calling the sample test application and verify the authorization

For convenience, we’ll store Alice’s and Bob’s tokens in environment variables (not recommended for production). Here Bob is assigned the `admin` role and Alice is assigned the `guest` role.

```bash 
export ALICE_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjIyNDEwODE1MzksIm5iZiI6MTUxNDg1MTEzOSwicm9sZSI6Imd1ZXN0Iiwic3ViIjoiWVd4cFkyVT0ifQ.ja1bgvIt47393ba_WbSBm35NrUhdxM4mOVQN8iXz8lk"
export BOB_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjIyNDEwODE1MzksIm5iZiI6MTUxNDg1MTEzOSwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwic3ViIjoiWVd4cFkyVT0ifQ.veMeVDYlulTdieeX-jxFZ_tCmqQ_K8rwx2OktUHv5Z0"
```

The policy we passed to Kyverno-Envoy-Plugin sidecar in the ConfigMap `policy-config` is configured to check the conditions of the incoming request and denies the request if the user is a guest and the request method is `POST` at the `/book` path.

```yaml
apiVersion: json.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
kind: ValidatingPolicy
metadata:
  name: checkrequest
spec:
  rules:
    - name: deny-guest-request-at-post
      assert:
        any:
        - message: "POST method calls at path /book are not allowed to guests users"
          check:
            request:
                http:
                    method: POST
                    headers:
                        authorization:
                            (split(@, ' ')[1]):
                                (jwt_decode(@ , 'secret').payload.role): admin
                    path: /book                             
        - message: "GET method call is allowed to both guest and admin users"
          check:
            request:
                http:
                    method: GET
                    headers:
                        authorization:
                            (split(@, ' ')[1]):
                                (jwt_decode(@ , 'secret').payload.role): admin
                    path: /book 
        - message: "GET method call is allowed to both guest and admin users"
          check:
            request:
                http:
                    method: GET
                    headers:
                        authorization:
                            (split(@, ' ')[1]):
                                (jwt_decode(@ , 'secret').payload.role): guest
                    path: /book               
```

Check for `Alice` which can get book but cannot create book.

```bash
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer "$ALICE_TOKEN"" http://$SERVICE_URL/book
```

```bash
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer "$ALICE_TOKEN"" -d '{"bookname":"Harry Potter", "author":"J.K. Rowling"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://$SERVICE_URL/book
```

Check the `Bob` which can get book also create the book 

```bash
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer "$BOB_TOKEN"" http://$SERVICE_URL/book
```

```bash
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer "$BOB_TOKEN"" -d '{"bookname":"Harry Potter", "author":"J.K. Rowling"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://$SERVICE_URL/book
```

Check on logs 

```bash
kubectl logs "$(kubectl get pod -l app=testapp -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})" -c kyverno-envoy-plugin -f
```

First , third and last request is passed but second request is failed.

```console 
$ kubectl logs "$(kubectl get pod -l app=testapp -n demo -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})" -n demo -c kyverno-envoy-plugin -f
