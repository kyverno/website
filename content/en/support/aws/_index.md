Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services (AWS) without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes clusters.

Kyverno is available as an ISV add-on for Amazon EKS. Please refer to the [EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-add-ons.html#workloads-add-ons-available-vendors) for details.

The Nirmata Kyverno distribution and Kubernetes governance platform are also available in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=e3783cfb-7d53-4c0d-a30e-b7e8c9d21ece).
