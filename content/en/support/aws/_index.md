Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services (AWS) without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes clusters.

The Nirmata Kyverno enterprise distribution and Kubernetes governance platform are available in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=e3783cfb-7d53-4c0d-a30e-b7e8c9d21ece).
