# Sample Policies

The policies here are maintained by the community and are as samples that demonstrate the power and flexibility of Kyverno. To use in your environment, make sure you test with the right versions of Kyverno and Kubernetes, and optimize for your use case.

Select the **Policy Type** and **Policy Category** on the left navigation, or use the search, to find the policy you need. 

You can contribute policies or request additional samples in the [kyverno/policies](https://github.com/kyverno/policies) Git repository.

Most validate policies here are set to `Audit` mode by default. To block resources immediately, set to `Enforce`.

For information on the Kyverno annotations listed in these policies, see [this page](https://github.com/kyverno/policies/wiki/Kyverno-annotations).
