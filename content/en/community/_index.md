## GitHub

The [Kyverno source code](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/) and project artifacts are managed on GitHub in the [Kyverno](https://github.com/kyverno) organization.

## Slack Channel

Kyverno maintains a thriving community with two different opportunities to participate. The largest is the [Kubernetes Slack workspace](https://slack.k8s.io/#kyverno), where end-users engage in the [#kyverno](https://slack.k8s.io/#kyverno) channel and contributors collaborate in the [#kyverno-dev](https://slack.k8s.io/#kyverno-dev) channel. The other is the [CNCF Slack workspace](https://cloud-native.slack.com/#kyverno), where the [#kyverno](https://slack.k8s.io/#kyverno) channel is dedicated to end-user interactions.

## Meetings

The Kyverno project holds two weekly meetings:

### Community Meeting

This is a public, weekly for Kyverno the full community. First time participants, new contributors, or anyone interested in Kyverno are welcome! This forum allows community members to propose agenda items of any sort, including but not limited to releases, roadmap, any contributor PRs or issues on which they are working.

- Weekly every Wednesday at 9:00 AM PST

## Join Kyverno Adopters

Kyverno is a CNCF incubating project and is growing fast. To qualify for the [graduation level](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md#graduation-stage) the CNCF requires production usage by multiple end users.

The goal of this adopters program is to gather real-world usage examples and help the Kyverno project grow. We hope to achieve this by learning from the existing and new adopters of Kyverno who are willing to share their stories with CNCF.

To participate, fill out the [Kyverno adopters form](https://forms.gle/K5CApcBAD5D4H1AG8).

## Project Governance

[Kyverno and its sub-projects](https://github.com/kyverno#projects) follow the governance published and maintained at https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md.
