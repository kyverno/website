This section covers the main Kyverno CLI commands, for other commands please refer to the [Reference documentation](/docs/kyverno-cli/reference/)

:::note[Working with kustomize]
When using the Kyverno CLI with [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/), it is recommended to use the "[standalone](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/binaries/)" version as opposed to the version embedded inside `kubectl`.
