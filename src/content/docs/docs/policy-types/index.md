Kyverno offers multiple policy types decribed below. Kyverno's mission is to be the best policy engine for Kubernetes, and allow applying Kubernetes style policies everywhere. As Kubernetes has evolved, Kyverno is also evolving its APIs. The Kyverno [ValidatingPolicy](/docs/policy-types/cel-policies/validating-policy) and [ImageValidatingPolicy](/docs/policy-types/cel-policies/image-validating-policy) types were introduced in v1.14 (April 2025), and [MutatingPolicy](/docs/policy-types/cel-policies/mutating-policy), [GeneratingPolicy](/docs/policy-types/cel-policies/generating-policy), and [DeletingPolicy](/docs/policy-types/cel-policies/deleting-policy) were added in v1.15 (July 2025).
