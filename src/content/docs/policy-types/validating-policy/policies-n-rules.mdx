A Kyverno ClusterPolicy contains a list of rules.

Policies with validation rules can be used to block insecure or non-compliant configurations by setting the failureAction to Enforce. Or, validation rules can be applied using periodic scans with results available as policy reports.

Rules in a policy are applied in the order of definition. During admission control, mutation rules are applied before validation rules. This allows validation of changes made during mutation. Note that all mutation rules are applied first across all policies before any validation rules are applied.

There is no ordering within or across policies and all matching policy rules will always be applied. For validate rules, this ordering is irrelevant, however for mutate and generate rules, if there is a cascading dependency, rules should be ordered according to those dependencies. Since validation rules are written as pass or fail conditions, rules cannot override other rules and can only extend the fail condition set. Hence, namespaced policies cannot override or modify behaviors described in a cluster-wide policy. Because policies are logical collections of related rules and do not imply functionality relative to other policies, a single policy having two validation rules, for example, produces the same ultimate effect as two policies each having one rule. Designing policies is therefore primarily an organizational concern and not a functional one.

Each rule consists of a match declaration, an optional exclude declaration, and one of a validate, mutate, generate, or verifyImages declaration. Each rule can contain only a single validate, mutate, generate, or verifyImages child declaration.
